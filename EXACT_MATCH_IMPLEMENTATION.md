# Exact Match Search Implementation

## Overview
Added exact match functionality for search queries when users enter search terms in quotes. This allows users to search for specific phrases exactly as written, while still supporting regular keyword searches.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Exact Phrase Detection
- Automatically detects quoted strings in search queries (e.g., `"search this"`)
- Extracts exact phrases and treats them as separate search criteria
- Supports multiple exact phrases in a single query

### 2. Mixed Search Support
- Combines exact phrases with regular keywords
- Example: `"data protection" privacy` searches for the exact phrase "data protection" AND the keyword "privacy"

### 3. Enhanced Relevance Scoring
- Exact phrases get higher weight (2 points) in relevance scoring
- Regular keywords get standard weight (1 point)
- Results are sorted by relevance score

### 4. Consistent Implementation
- Main search page (`/`)
- Law view page (`/law/<id>`)
- Article view page (`/article/<id>`)
- All use the same parsing logic

## Technical Implementation

### New Function: `parse_search_query(query)`
```python
def parse_search_query(query):
    """
    Parse search query to extract exact phrases (quoted strings) and regular keywords.
    Returns tuple of (exact_phrases, keywords)
    """
```

### Search Logic Updates
- **Match All**: Requires ALL exact phrases AND keywords to be found
- **Match Any**: Requires ANY exact phrase OR keyword to be found
- SQL queries updated to handle both types of search terms

### UI Enhancements
- Updated placeholder text to show examples of exact phrase usage
- Added search tips section explaining how to use quotes
- Visual indicator when exact phrase search is enabled

## Usage Examples

### Exact Phrase Only
```
"search this"
```
Finds text containing the exact phrase "search this"

### Mixed Search
```
"data protection" privacy
```
Finds text containing the exact phrase "data protection" AND the keyword "privacy"

### Multiple Exact Phrases
```
"criminal procedure" "evidence act" 2024
```
Finds text containing both exact phrases "criminal procedure" and "evidence act", plus the keyword "2024"
