Law on Prioritizing the National Language of the Maldives

Introduction and Name

1.
(a) This is a law enacted by the citizens of the Maldives to fulfill the important responsibility of protecting, preserving, reviving, sustaining, developing, enriching, and faithfully passing on the Dhivehi language to future generations. This is because Article 11 of the Constitution of the Republic of the Maldives declares Dhivehi as the national language, and the Dhivehi language is one of the strongest pillars of Maldivian nationality. In a globalizing world where cultures and languages intertwine, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has warned of the danger of extinction for languages with small speaking populations. Therefore, it is deemed necessary for Maldivians to take immediate measures for its protection, as it is the responsibility of every generation of Maldivians.

(b) This law shall be cited as the "Law on Prioritizing the National Language of the Maldives".

Objective

2.
(a) The main objective of this law is to protect the Dhivehi language, which is one of the most important foundations of Maldivian nationality and one of its most valuable heritages, from decline, while developing and promoting the language and passing it on faithfully to future generations.

(b) The details of the main objective stated in subsection (a) of this article are as follows:
(1) As the Dhivehi language is a fundamental principle of the unity of the Maldives and the mother tongue of Maldivians, to prioritize the use of the Dhivehi language, the official language of the Maldives, in official communications.
(2) To develop and promote the Dhivehi language and to protect it from factors that lead to its decline.
(3) To maintain the Dhivehi language as a language used in common communication.
(4) To create a national framework to increase the attention given to the Dhivehi language by Maldivians, to plan, promote, implement, and review activities necessary for the development of the Dhivehi language, and to determine the objectives of that body.
