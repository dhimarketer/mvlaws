8. Temporariness

"Temporariness" in relation to an assembly is stated to be a length or duration determined based on the following principles:

And in such an assembly, no act contrary to the law shall be committed, nor shall any act be conducted that encourages such an act. Nor shall any object that could be used for assault or cause any harm be carried.

Chapter Seven
Giving Notice

27. Giving Notice

(a) It is not required to obtain permission for holding a particular assembly.
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this article, in the case of an organized assembly, the organizer of that assembly must give notice to the police authority that the assembly is being held.
(c) Giving notice as per subsection (b) of this article is not the obtaining of a permission for that assembly.
(d) The purpose of the notice given as per subsection (b) of this article is to give the police authority adequate time to take the following necessary preparatory measures in relation to that assembly:
(1) To make arrangements for the smooth conduct of the assembly.
(2) To make arrangements to protect the rights of other people.
(3) To allow time to prepare to take necessary measures to maintain public safety and public peace.
(4) If the police authority finds it necessary to impose any restriction on an assembly within the scope of this law, to allow time to inform the organizer of that assembly of the matter.
(5) To allow time for the party dissatisfied with a notification made as per sub-paragraph (4) of this section to submit the matter to court to seek a decision.

28. Methods of Giving Notice

The police authority shall make arrangements for notice of holding an assembly to be given by letter, email, or text message, and the police authority shall publicly announce the detailed procedures for doing so.

29. Information to be Included in the Notice

A notice of holding an assembly shall include the following information:
(a) Details of the police authority to which the notice is addressed.
(b) The subject of the assembly being held.
(c) The time of the assembly, and the estimated duration for which the assembly is believed to continue.
(d) The place where the assembly is being held.
(e) If any road needs to be used in the assembly, that fact.
(f) The name and address of the organizing party.
(g) A contact phone number.
(h) The date and time the notice was given.

30. Period of Notice

(a) Notice of holding an assembly shall be given at least 36 hours before holding the assembly for which the notice is given.
(b) The period stipulated in subsection (a) of this article is provided to give the police authority time to make necessary preparations for holding the assembly, to notify the organizer of the assembly of any conditions the police authority may impose in relation to the assembly, and if the organizer of the assembly is dissatisfied with such conditions, to give the organizer of that assembly the opportunity to seek a decision through a court of law on the matter.

31. Exemption of Spontaneous Assemblies from Giving Notice

(a) The procedure of giving notice specified in Article 27 of this law shall not apply to a spontaneous assembly.
(b) If a spontaneous assembly is a peaceful assembly, from the time the police authority receives information about that assembly, it must be protected and the way must be paved for that assembly to be held.
(c) For a spontaneous assembly to be exempted from the notice-giving procedure, holding an organized assembly as a spontaneous assembly, taking unfair advantage of the no-notice rule, and holding every assembly as a spontaneous assembly, is not something this law permits. As a spontaneous assembly becomes a spontaneous assembly because it is an assembly held in relation to a sudden event, a "sudden event" shall be interpreted narrowly.

32. Organizing a Demonstration

(a) Before holding organized assemblies, after the organizer has given notice of the assembly, they must hold administrative consultations with the police authority.
(b) The administrative consultations mentioned in subsection (a) of this article shall be based on the following matters:

Chapter Eight
Restricting the Right of Assembly

33. Circumstances in which the Right of Assembly may be Restricted

(a) Whereas Article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that the right of freedom of assembly may be restricted by a provision of law and to a degree necessary in democratic societies for the protection of the following interests, this chapter sets out how those interests shall be defined in the Maldives, and how the scope of those interests is determined in the Maldives.
(1) A matter that may pose a danger to national security.

34. Principles for Restricting the Right of Assembly

The right of assembly may be restricted in accordance with the following principles:
(a) Having a legitimate reason in law.
(1) Any restriction on an assembly can only be brought with a clear reference to a reason permitted by law for doing so.
(2) A restriction brought based on the reason stated in subsection (a)(1) of this article must also be a restriction that falls within the principles of human rights.
(3) The reason stated in subsection (a)(1) of this article must, after being referred to, be a matter from which the organizer of the assembly can clearly understand that their specific act or a particular way of doing things falls under that reason.
(b) Proportionality.
Any restriction brought in relation to an assembly must be a measure that is proportional to the necessary extent to protect the interest that needs to be protected. And that measure must also be a measure that causes the least disruption possible to achieve the purpose of the assembly.
(c) Non-discrimination.
(1) The right to freedom of assembly must be a right that can be exercised by everyone on an equal basis.
(2) Assemblies held in similar circumstances must be treated with the same principle. Assemblies held in similar circumstances must not be treated with different principles.
(3) A measure taken by the police authority or by State institutions in relation to the freedom of assembly must not be a measure that is noted as an act of discriminating against a particular group or giving priority to a particular group.

35. Circumstances in which the Right of Assembly Cannot be Restricted

Unless otherwise stated in this law, the following matters are not in themselves reasons for which the right of assembly can be restricted:
(a) The place where the assembly is held.

(j) The assembly being one that calls for the resignation of a particular person; or an assembly where changing the government through legal and regulatory means is discussed.
(k) The assembly being one that requires the temporary closure of roads and alleys.
(l) The assembly being one for which the required security could not be fully provided by the police authority.

36. Standard for Danger to National Security

The standard for danger to national security shall be enforced for an act that occurs within the scope of how an act that could endanger national security is defined in Article 274(a) of the Constitution. That is, the occurrence of major harm to the sovereignty or independence of the Maldives, or to the lives, bodies, or property of people. This includes terrorist attacks and hostile acts using weapons. However, this does not in itself include peaceful activities conducted without violating the law to support or oppose various matters by using a legal right afforded to the people.

37. Standard for Maintaining Public Safety

When restricting the right of assembly, the standard for maintaining public safety shall be enforced for a matter that falls within the scope of matters for which the police are empowered by relevant law to take action in relation to a criminal offense.

When restricting the right of assembly, the standard for protecting public health shall be enforced in accordance with the relevant law on a matter that must be done to save people from such a thing, during a period when a dangerous epidemic or a dangerous communicable disease has been declared to be spreading.

40. Standard for Protecting General Moral Standards

When restricting the right of assembly, the standard for protecting general moral standards shall be enforced within the scope of Law No. 11/2010 (Prevention of Acts Contrary to General Social Standards Act).

41. Standard for Protecting the Rights of Other Parties

While this law recognizes that the temporary suspension of a freedom or right belonging to another party due to an assembly is a matter inherent in the nature of an assembly, this law also recognizes that this should happen to a reasonable extent. Therefore, because an assembly is held at a specific place, having regard to the extent to which the rights are repeatedly suspended for the parties affected by that assembly, it is a matter permitted by this law for the police authority to instruct the organizer of that assembly to do one of the following:
(a) To shorten the time of the assembly.

(a) If any kind of restriction is imposed in relation to an organized assembly, that matter, after stating the reason and providing details in writing, must be communicated to the organizer of that assembly within 12 hours of the police authority receiving the notice of the assembly.
(b) If a restriction stated in a notification as per subsection (a) of this article is, in the view of the organizer of that assembly, a restriction contrary to this law, that party has the opportunity to submit the matter to court to seek a decision on the matter.
(c) If a case is submitted to court under subsection (b) of this article, that court must make a decision on the matter within 12 hours of the case being submitted.
(d) If the police authority imposes a restriction in relation to a spontaneous assembly, the police authority must inform the organizer of that assembly as soon as possible from the moment information of that assembly is received. And, if dissatisfied with such a notification, the organizer of that assembly has the power to submit the matter to court. And, if such a case is submitted to court, that court must make a decision on the matter at the earliest possible opportunity, but within a maximum of 12 hours.

(a) Instructing an assembly to be held at a specific place at a specific time;
(b) Except for the safety of the participants of an assembly, making a change to the route designated for a procession;
(c) Participating in the assembly as participants of that assembly;

(h) Engaging in dispersing an assembly in a manner other than in a police uniform; or engaging in dispersing an assembly while covering the face, in a way that is not part of riot gear.

44. Dispersing an Assembly

(a) Regarding the dispersal of an assembly, the role of the police will mainly be based on doing so in a situation where dispersing the assembly is permitted under this law, and on enforcing any restriction that has been imposed in relation to that assembly.
(b) An assembly shall be dispersed only when one of the following situations arises:
(1) A court order is issued to bring the assembly to an end; or

(3) The police believe that acts of violence are occurring in the assembly or that it includes calls that encourage the commission of acts of violence; or
(4) The police believe that the interest of the assembly has deteriorated to the point where public interest cannot be restored even by using the means used by the police to quell the events that harm public interest in that assembly; or
(5) If a group from among the participants of the assembly attempts to cross the barriers or lines placed by the police in the area of the assembly to provide security, or to organize it, or to protect the rights of others, and then breaks through the police line, and this is believed by the police to be a characteristic of the entire assembly rather than just an act of a specific group; or
(6) Any participant in the assembly attacks a police officer using a sword, knife, dagger, piece of wood, rod, iron bar, club, bleach, petrol, acid, or any such object that can be used as a weapon, or an explosive device, or any type of object used by the police authority for law enforcement or to establish public interest; or
(7) The assembly is held in an area where holding an assembly is not permitted; or
(8) The participants of the assembly or the organizer of the assembly act in contravention of a restriction imposed in relation to the assembly.
(c) If, when one of the situations described in sub-paragraphs (1) to (7) of subsection (b) of this article occurs, an assembly is dispersed at the discretion of the police, and the organizer of that assembly is dissatisfied with the action, that organizer has the power to submit the matter to court and request the court to make a decision on that police decision.
