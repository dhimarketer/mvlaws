Act on the Principles of Interpretation

Introduction and Name
1.
(a) This is the Act specifying the legal principles to be referred to in translating, interpreting, or enforcing the laws passed by the People's Majlis and the regulations made under the authority of those laws.[1]
(b) This Act shall be cited as the "Interpretation Act".[1]

Objective
2.
The purpose of this Act is to achieve the following objectives:
(a) To establish, as uniformly as possible, the principles for translating, interpreting, and enforcing the laws and regulations in effect in the Maldives.[1]
(b) To indicate to legal bodies and judicial courts the principles to be followed in interpreting, translating, and enforcing the law.[1]

The Literal Rule
3.
The literal rule shall be used in interpreting the law to achieve the following:
(a) To give precedence to maintaining the ordinary meaning conveyed by the word, phrase, or sentence used to state a particular matter in a law passed by the People's Majlis.
(b) To recognize that the power to determine the intended meaning of a specific word, phrase, or sentence used in a law rests with the People's Majlis, and to consider that there is no better way than to uphold the word, phrase, or sentence used by the People's Majlis in a law to state a particular matter.
(c) Where the usage of a word, phrase, or sentence conveys a specific meaning, it shall be considered improper to broaden that meaning or to attempt to include matters not contained therein.
(d) To consider that the word, phrase, or sentence used to state a particular matter in the formulation of the law properly symbolizes the intent of the party that formulated the law.[1]

The Mischief Rule
4.
(a) The mischief rule shall be used in interpreting a law to ensure that the law, which was intended to provide a solution to a problem, is enforced in its proper context, applying to newly arising matters and circumstances.[2]
(b) In interpreting laws, the following matters shall be considered when using the mischief rule:[3][4]
1. The state of affairs before the introduction of the law.
2. The defect that the law was introduced to remedy.[2]
3. What defect the People's Majlis sought to remedy and what solution it intended to provide in formulating the law.
4. The true purpose of the solution provided by the People's Majlis in the law.

The Golden Rule
5.
The purpose of the golden rule is to be used when a word, phrase, or sentence used in the formulation of a law conveys more than one meaning, and where acting upon the commonly understood meaning would likely lead to an inherently contradictory result, or where acting upon its common meaning would require a decision contrary to the concept embodied in the entire law. In such instances, to eliminate the possibility of the contradictory result or to nullify the conflict with the concept of the law, a special meaning is used instead of the commonly understood meaning of the word, phrase, or sentence, and that special meaning is applied.

The Purposive Approach
6.
(a) The purposive approach is, instead of looking at the specific way a word, phrase, or sentence is used, to look at the purpose held by the People's Majlis in passing the law, and after ascertaining that purpose, to interpret the word, phrase, or sentence in a manner consistent with and that revives and fosters that purpose.[2]
(b) For the purpose of ascertaining the objective of the People's Majlis as stated in subsection (a), legally permissible means may be used in the court's proceedings.[2]

Discretion to Use a Particular Rule
7.
Whether it be the literal rule, the mischief rule, the golden rule, or the purposive approach, the judge is vested with the discretion to determine which rule must be used to establish justice in the situation before the court, and to establish justice in accordance with that rule.[2] In such a situation, if one rule is prioritized over another, the judge must state why they have done so.[2]

Some Principles of Interpretation
8.
(a) If, after mentioning a particular group or a particular thing using specific terms, a law then refers to such a general group or things using general terms, that general reference shall be deemed to apply only to the people or things of that specific class.
(b) If a word that conveys more than one meaning is used, its true meaning shall be determined by looking at the context in which the word is interpreted, or the meaning conveyed by the other words and phrases to which it is connected.[2]
(c) If a particular thing or a particular person is expressly stated in a law, its meaning is that the principle in that law does not apply to other persons or other things.[2]

Aids to Interpretation
9.
Aids that may be sought in interpreting a law are divided into two categories. They are aids that can be used from within the law, and aids that can be used from outside the law.

Internal Aids for Interpreting a Law
10.
To determine the meaning of a particular word, multiple words, or a sentence, assistance may be sought from the following aids within that law:
(a) By reading the paragraph, article, or chapter containing a particular word, multiple words, or a sentence in a law, the meaning with which the word, multiple words, or sentence is used, or its position or context, can be determined.
(b) The purpose of the law can also be determined from the concept stated in the title of the law.
(c) The purpose of formulating the law can also be determined from the concept stated in the preamble of the law.
(d) The meaning of a word can also be determined from punctuation marks considered to be rules of writing, such as commas, semicolons, colons, and full stops that end a sentence.

External Aids for Interpreting a Law
11.
To determine the meaning of a particular word, phrase, or sentence, assistance may be sought from the following aids outside of that law:
(a) The reason for which that law or that article of the law was formulated.
(b) The way that word is used in a reliable dictionary.
(c) Various reliable scholarly works written and published on the subject.
(d) The commonly practiced custom or the way that word has been accepted and acted upon.
(e) The place and manner in which a word related to the article or subject to be interpreted has been used in another law.
(f) Official reports and studies published during the formulation of a law.
(g) International treaties and agreements.
(h) The minutes of debates held in the sessions of the People's Majlis and studies conducted in committees.

Acceptable Principles in Law Interpretation
12.
Unless expressly stated otherwise, the following matters are acceptable principles in interpreting the law:
(a) To consider every law as a law introduced to rectify something that occurred before its formulation, or to fill a deficiency or a void that existed at that time.[5]
(b) To consider that an Act would not abolish the power of the judicial courts.[5]
(c) To consider that an Act would not completely take away a right that has been granted.[5]
(d) To interpret laws that determine punishments in a manner that is favorable to the person accused of the crime.[5]
(e) For a law to be effective from the day of its formulation onwards, and for that law not to be an instrument that applies to an act that occurred before the date of the law.[5]
(f) If the manner in which a word, a term, multiple words, or a sentence is used is in a simple word, a simple term, a simple phrase, or a simple sentence that does not convey more than one meaning, the principle to be accepted is that what is stated in the law is how the People's Majlis wanted to state it. And the meaning conveyed by that law is the meaning the People's Majlis intended to convey.[5]
(g) If a word has been given a specific, well-known, or widely used interpretation in line with the times, the meaning to be chosen as the meaning of that word, instead of its original meaning, its etymological meaning, or its formal meaning, is the meaning considered for that word in that society at that time.
(h) If a word is given a special interpretation in a particular field, a particular trade, or a particular profession, precedence shall be given to the special interpretation given in that field, that profession, or that trade over its general interpretation.

Principles Relating to Laws
13.
Every law passed by the People's Majlis must be accepted by the judicial courts as a valid law. No party needs to undertake additional efforts to prove the validity of that law.

Schedules
14.
Schedules included with a law shall be considered an important part of that law. It shall also be considered that the law would not be complete without those schedules. Every reference to the law shall be considered a reference to the schedule as well.

Parts of a Law
15.
(a) If a law is divided into different parts, chapters, or under different headings, it shall be accepted that the law is complete with all those parts together.
(b) If a copy of a form is included in a law and filling that form is made mandatory under that law, it is permissible to fill that form with changes that do not fundamentally conflict with the copy of the form.
(c) Examples included in a law to explain certain concepts of the law shall be considered part of the law. Accordingly, if there is any conflict between an example presented in a law and the text of the law, precedence shall be given to the text of the law.
(d) When referring to a law, it is sufficient to refer to the title of that law. Or it is sufficient to refer to the serial number given to that law.
(e) If any law refers to a specific part, chapter, schedule, number, or article number of a law without specifying a particular law, it shall be considered a reference to a part, chapter, schedule, or number of that same law.
(f) If a specific article of a law refers to a letter or a paragraph without referring to another law or an article of another law, it shall be considered a reference to a letter or a paragraph of that same article.

Parts Not Included as Part of the Law
16.
Marginal headings and marginal notes contained in a law are not part of that law. And those marginal headings and notes are used in that law solely for ease of use.

Interpreting the Law
17.
In interpreting a law, precedence must be given to interpreting the law in a way that achieves the objective for which that law was formulated, or the goals it seeks to achieve. And that law shall not be interpreted in a way that would not achieve its objectives.

Commencement of a Law on a Specific Day
18.
If it is stated that a law shall commence on a specific day, that law shall commence at the end of the preceding day.

Repeal of a Law
19.
(a) If a part of a law is removed from that law, any regulation made under that law or under that removed part of the law shall remain in force. This is as long as it does not conflict with the repealed or annulled law.
(b) When a law is repealed, unless interpreted otherwise, the following matters shall be accepted as not occurring:
1. The belief that something not created or not existing under that law at the time specified for its repeal will be created or will exist after the law is repealed.
2. The invalidation of actions taken under that law up to the point of its repeal.
3. The nullification of a right or privilege obtained by a person, or a responsibility or duty that a person was required to bear, up to the point the repealed law was repealed.
4. The nullification of a fine imposed on a person, the seizure of a person's property, or a punishment given to a person under that law.
5. The nullification of any investigation conducted, legal proceedings undertaken, or judicial work performed.

General Principles Regarding Making Regulations
20.
(a) If the power to make regulations under a specific law is given to a specific party, unless otherwise stated in that law, the following principles shall apply to the regulations made under that law:
1. If a regulation made under that law contradicts the concept of the law, the party that made the regulation has the power to change, amend, and repeal that regulation.
2. The party that initiated the regulation has the power to repeal that regulation, create a new regulation in its place, and amend that regulation, by the same procedure through which it was formulated and brought into effect.
3. If the domain or the work of the government agency for which the regulation is designated to apply is transferred to another agency, or if it is included within the work of another agency, the matters attributed to that agency in the regulation shall be transferred to the subsequent agency to which the work was transferred.
(b) The power granted to make regulations includes the power to do the following:
1. If the regulation is violated, the power to impose a fine not exceeding MVR 2,000 (two thousand Rufiyaa).
2. The power to do things in the manner specified in the regulation.
3. The power to amend forms specified in the law without losing their original substance, or the power to introduce new forms not specified in the law. A reasonable opportunity must be given to use such newly introduced forms.
4. The power to determine the method for obtaining a document, record, permit, or license specified in the law, and the cost incurred for it.
5. The power to determine a fine under the authority given by the law, and the power to change that fine, similar to the power to determine it.
(c) On occasions where a law is referenced, a reference may also be made to the regulations made under that law.
(d) If specific words used in a regulation made under a law are words that have been given a specific interpretation in the law from which the power to make the regulation was derived, those words shall also be used in the regulation with the same meaning as they are used in that law.
(e) A regulation made under the authority of a law shall be accepted by the courts as a valid instrument.
(f) Actions performed, actions conducted, things left undone, and things done under a regulation shall be considered as things done under the law.

Using the Power Vested in the President of the Republic
27.
In situations where the President of the Republic is granted the power to issue a specific order or a specific directive, and as long as it is not stated that it must be done through a document directly signed and issued by the President of the Republic, if a minister authorized on behalf of the President of the Republic or the Cabinet Secretary signs that order or issues that directive, it shall be considered that the President of the Republic issued that order or gave that directive.

Using the Power Vested in a Minister
28.
As long as a specific matter is not required to be done through a document directly signed and issued by the Minister, when directives that need to be given on behalf of the Minister are given by their deputy or the Permanent Secretary of the ministry they are in charge of, with the Minister's permission, it shall be considered that the Minister gave that directive.

Doing a Specific Thing on Behalf of the President of the Republic

Regarding Crimes
31.
(a) In a situation where attempting to commit a crime is not designated as a separate crime in the law related to that crime and a separate punishment is not prescribed for it, attempting to commit a crime may be considered a crime, and a judicial court may impose a punishment not exceeding 75 (seventy-five) percent of the punishment prescribed for committing that crime on the person who attempted to commit it.
(b) Giving a person a punishment as per a law is not a reason that would limit the opportunity to seek compensation in a civil claim.

Regarding the Amount of a Fine
32.
If a specific amount or a fine is prescribed in a law, unless expressly stated otherwise in that law, if a specific amount is prescribed or a fine is prescribed, it must always be considered that the amount prescribed in the law is the maximum amount. And that it can be done for a lower amount.
