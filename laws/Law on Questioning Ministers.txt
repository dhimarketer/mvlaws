Introduction and Name

1.
(a) This is the law that sets out the procedures for questioning ministers in the People's Majlis, and the procedures for ministers to answer questions.

(b) This law shall be cited as the "Law on Questioning Ministers."

Scope of Questioning

2.
(a) A minister may be questioned in the People's Majlis about an act done or undertaken in an official capacity.

(b) Within 30 days of a minister assuming responsibility for a ministry, that minister must inform the People's Majlis of the acts or undertakings of that ministry.

(c) A minister may be questioned in the People's Majlis about a personal act or undertaking only if the act is suspected of being contrary to the law, or if it is an act that could cause harm to the government or the people.

(d) For the purpose of this article, an official act or undertaking of a minister includes acts done, undertakings conducted, and omissions made in relation to the responsibilities assigned to him at the time of questioning. Likewise, for the purpose of this article, a personal act or undertaking of a minister includes acts done, undertakings conducted, and omissions made after assuming the responsibilities assigned to him at the time of questioning.

Giving Notice of a Question

(a) A member of the People's Majlis shall question a minister through the Speaker of the People's Majlis, by sending a written notice of the question, after giving a period of 14 days, during a sitting of the Majlis.[1]

(b) In giving notice of a question under sub-article (a), a member shall give a separate notice for each topic or matter about which they wish to question a minister. This rule does not prevent a member from asking a minister more than one question related to the same topic or matter in a single notice.

(c) In calculating the period mentioned in sub-article (a), official holidays shall be included.

(d) The date.

Questions Requiring an Answer

5. Unless otherwise stated in this law, a minister is obliged to answer a question unless the question is of the following nature:

(4) Information that is prohibited from disclosure under a law.

Exception to the Rule

6. None of the rules stated in Article 5 of this law shall apply to a question asked under Article 2(c) of this law. When a question is asked under that sub-article, the minister to whom the question is addressed must answer it.

Answering Orally

7.
(a) If a question asked by a member to a minister is not one that requires the disclosure or presentation of statistics, financial accounts, or other detailed information, the minister shall give a full answer to that question orally, when given the opportunity by the Speaker of the Majlis, by attending the sitting scheduled for the questioning.

(b) The minister being questioned shall answer the question from a member as completely as possible, directly addressing the question asked.

Answering in Writing

8. If a question asked by a member to a minister requires an answer that discloses or presents statistics, financial accounts, or other detailed information, or if the question can only be fully answered by disclosing such detailed information, the minister shall answer the question as follows, upon attending the sitting scheduled for the questioning and being given the opportunity by the Speaker of the Majlis:
(a) If the entire answer consists of detailed information, recite a summary of that information to the Majlis and state that the information is being submitted to the Majlis in writing.
(b) If the answer is complete only by including detailed information, after finishing the answer to the question, recite a summary of the detailed information related to the answer to the Majlis and state that the information is being submitted to the Majlis in writing.
(c) If a minister states that detailed information will be submitted as per sub-articles (a) and (b), the Speaker of the Majlis shall announce that the document will be included in the day's official record (Hansard) and that copies of those documents will be distributed to the members.

Failure to Answer and Provision of False Information

9. If a minister fails to answer a question asked with notice in accordance with this law, or if a member of the Majlis believes that false information has been given or a matter has been misrepresented in the answer, a motion of no-confidence against that minister may be submitted to the Majlis in accordance with Article 82 of the Constitution.[1]

Scheduling Time for Questioning and Answering

10. If a member has given notice to question a minister, the Speaker of the Majlis shall, after allowing the 14-day period mentioned in Article 3 for the minister in question, schedule a time for the question to be asked and answered.[2]

Postponement of a Sitting for Questioning

11. If the questioning of a minister and the minister's answer are on the agenda for a sitting, and that sitting is postponed for any reason, or the sitting concludes before reaching that agenda item, the questioning or answering shall be rescheduled for the next earliest sitting.

Power to Determine if an Answer is Required

(b) In exercising the discretion under sub-article (a), the Speaker of the Majlis shall consider the following:
(1) Whether the question asks for information such as statistics and administrative details;
(2) Whether the nature of the question is such that a short answer would not suffice.

Withdrawal of a Question

14.
(a) A member may withdraw a question they have submitted, even after notice has been given to the minister, at any time before the day scheduled for the answer.
(b) If a member does not ask their question during the opportunity provided by the Speaker, they will not be given a second opportunity to ask that question.

Opportunity for Supplementary Questions

16. The Speaker of the Majlis shall grant the opportunity for a supplementary question if it arises from the original notified question or the minister's answer to it, provided the supplementary question is not intended to seek a simple "yes" or "no" to something the minister has already stated.
