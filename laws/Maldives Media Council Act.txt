Principles to be Upheld by the Council

22.
(a) To accept that media freedom is a matter that entails greater responsibilities and duties than the right of the people to know, and to accept that the responsibility of those who work in the media is a responsibility owed to the people.
(b) To accept that the freedom to publish various things through the media is a freedom similar to the right of the people to know, to consider this as the basis of the position that the media should have in a free democratic society, and to accept that the right to publish reasonable information that is considered news in the media and the opportunity to publish such information without bias towards any party, or without leaning towards any party, or without the influence of any party, is also included in that freedom.

Principles to be Considered by the Council

    The Council shall consider the following principles when investigating matters submitted to it:
    (a) That information that is known to be definitively false or that can be considered to be possibly false shall not be published by any media outlet.
    (b) That information received by the media shall not be published without checking whether it is true, when there is an opportunity to do so.
    (c) If false information is published, upon knowing that the information is false, as soon as possible, to apologize for it, and to state that the written piece is retracted or corrected or further explained and clarified or that an apology is made for it. And to do what is stated to be done in that way.
    (d) That the parties who receive media outlets have the right to accept that the information published in the media is information published and delivered with fairness and truthfulness. And that the parties who receive media outlets also have the right to accept that such information is delivered to them in a manner that respects the sphere of personal freedom of individuals and with the due respect and honor given to that party.
    (e) That the statement of the sphere of personal freedom shall not be construed to mean that information that is publicly available and information that is necessary or important for society to know is information connected to personal freedom and withheld.
    (f) If hearsay and uncorroborated stories are to be published, it must be clear in that publication that they are such stories.
    (g) Any information published by a media outlet on a matter where there is a difference of opinion must meet the following standards:
    (1) The distinction between fact and a personal opinion expressed by a person on a fact must be clearly marked.
    (2) Information that does not reveal the truth in a confusing manner should not be disclosed and true information should not be withheld.
    (3) A matter that is considered to be true should not be presented in a way that makes it seem unbelievable by information or any other symbol.
    (4) If there is any personal interest in expressing a piece of news or information or an opinion, that interest must be disclosed.
    (5) Information about any party's finances and indebtedness, and personal information that is considered to be part of any party's dignity, and false stories that could harm their reputation or honor or mislead people should not be disclosed.
    (6) Although the media has the full discretion to publish information, if it is something that could harm general social standards, the media must be responsible in its publication.
    (7) If something is published criticizing a particular party or a particular group, it must be done with fairness, justice, and love for ethics.
    (8) Matters that the Council highlights as matters noted by the Council must be published if they can be easily made public in the relevant outlet.
    (9) When the Council investigates and makes decisions on various matters, the reason why the media personnel wanted to do it that way in the submitted matter, and the right of the people to know, must be balanced.

Standards for Disclosing Personal Information of Various Parties

24.
(a) People working in the media shall seek personal information of various parties only if there is a public interest in it. In seeking such information, one must not unlawfully enter into the sphere of personal freedom of any of those parties. And their dignity and honor must always be respected.
(b) Personal information sought about a specific person shall be published only for the purpose for which it was sought. And the person who provides personal information about that person also has the right to accept that they are providing it for a specific purpose or that the party receiving that information is receiving it for a specific purpose, and the person to whom that information pertains also has the right to accept that.
(c) The personal information sought about a particular party must be true, complete, and the most recent information.
(d) The personal information of a particular party sought by people working in the media must be kept securely in a way that prevents its misuse, or its loss, or its being seen or obtained by an unauthorized party.
(e) The parties who provide information to the various media outlets have the right to be protected. And when disclosing information received in a way that the identity of the informant is unknown, it is not something that a person working in the media should do to disclose the details of that party, as long as disclosing the informant is not required by law.
(f) If expressing an opinion criticizing a particular party, it must be done with fairness and equality. And if the personal information disclosed about a particular party is not true, it must be corrected and rectified in a prominent way in the same outlet at the earliest possible opportunity. And that information must not be used a second time.

Submitting Complaints

    In relation to matters that occur in violation of the stated principles, any person and any group may submit a complaint to the Council in the following manner:
    (a) If dissatisfied with or objecting to something published in a media outlet, the matter shall first be brought to the notice of the editor of that outlet or the person responsible for the writings of that outlet. And an effort shall be made to find a suitable solution to the issue that has arisen through discussion between the two parties.
    (b) If no solution is found by working as stated in clause (a) of this Article, the complaint may be submitted to the Council. When submitting a complaint, the number of the outlet to which the complaint relates, the date on which that outlet was published, and if it is a printed outlet, the page on which the writing is, and a photocopy or a scanned copy of the published item, or a scene or a clipping from it, must be submitted with the complaint. And if it is information published on a website, the URL address of that website must be disclosed. And if possible, a printout of it should also be provided.
    (c) If a complaint submitted to the Council is a matter that can be resolved amicably, the President of the Council shall inform the editor of the media outlet to which the matter relates and work to resolve the matter. And if, after the editor of that outlet or, in the case of a website, the person responsible for the information contained on that website or the webmaster of that website has been notified that a complaint related to that outlet has been received, no response of any kind has been given within 1 (one) week, the Council will officially begin to investigate the matter.
    (d) If a matter submitted to the Council is a matter for which a lawsuit can be filed under a right granted by a law, the Council shall begin to investigate the matter only after the person has made a written and signed agreement with the Council that he is waiving that legal right. The agreement shall be signed after fully considering the nature and extent of the right being waived, and the consequences that will result from it. And if appropriate, legal advice should also be sought in the matter. The Council uses such an agreement because the Council is not a place where cases that can be conducted in judicial courts are submitted instead of the judicial court, and because the Council is a place that resolves matters outside of the judicial courts.
    (e) After reviewing a complaint submitted to the Council, if the complaint is not a complaint submitted in connection with an act committed in violation of the rules established by the Council, the Council may, by stating the reason, bring the matter of the complaint to a close at that point.
    (f) If the Council finds that a complaint submitted to it is a complaint that can be investigated more thoroughly by another body, it may, after informing the reason, decide to refer the complaint to another party.
    (g) If an amicable solution is found by the Council working in accordance with clause (n) of this Article, the matter of the complaint will come to an end at that point. And if such an amicable solution is not found, the Council shall give a notice to the media outlet to which the matter relates that it is officially investigating the matter. And when giving that notice, all the documents submitted to the Council by the party who submitted the matter must be sent with that notice. If the Council gives any kind of notice to a media outlet, it must respond to it within the period specified by the Council.
    (h) If a media outlet gives a response to a notice given to it by the Council in connection with a complaint, the Council may act in one of the following two ways:
    (1) If the response given by that outlet is a suitable response, to bring the matter to a close, or
    (2) If the response given by that outlet is an unsuitable response, to see if the matter can be resolved through amicable discussion through a member from among the members of the Council.
    (i) If the matter is resolved by amicable discussion as stated in clause (h) of this Article, the matter is concluded at that point. And if the matter is not resolved by amicable discussion or if the party who submitted the matter or the party to whom the matter is referred objects to doing so, the Council shall investigate the matter.
    (j) When the Council begins to investigate a matter, it shall inform both parties involved in the matter of the date, time, and the estimated time that will be spent on investigating the matter at a specific meeting of the Council. It is not mandatory for the two parties to be present at the time the matter is being investigated. However, the Council will encourage both parties involved in the matter to be present at that meeting.
    (k) The decision made by the Council after investigating a matter must clearly state how the matter occurred, a summary of the matter, and the points noted by the Council in the matter.
    (l) Every decision made by the Council must be sent in writing to the responsible party of the media outlet to which the decision relates. And the receipt of that letter by that party must be confirmed in writing.
    (m) The Council will not disclose that information to any other party until the information is published by the outlet to which the Council's decision relates, for the period given for the first publication. However, if that information is not disclosed by the specified outlet or if it becomes impossible to disclose it, then the Council has the right to publish that information in another outlet.
    (n) If a party is dissatisfied with a decision made by the Council, that party may apply to the President of the Council to have the matter reviewed again. If such an application is made, the President of the Council may act as follows:
    (1) If the party who applied to have the matter reviewed again has applied without a reasonable cause and only because they are dissatisfied with it, to drop the matter at that point without investigating it.
    (2) If the application to have the matter reviewed again because of dissatisfaction with the way the matter was decided is an application based on reasonable grounds, the President of the Council shall bring the matter back to the Council and propose to the Council to have the matter reviewed a second time.
    (o) If, after investigating a complaint submitted regarding any outlet, the Council instructs that its decision be published in that outlet, that statement must be published as instructed. If it is not published in that way, the Council has the right to publish that statement in another outlet.

Power to Investigate and Inquire

Giving the Opportunity to Speak

If such an opportunity is not given to him by the Council, the way the Council decided the matter will not be a valid way.

Compliance with Orders
