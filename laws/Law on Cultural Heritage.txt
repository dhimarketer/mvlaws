"Law on Cultural Heritage of the Maldives," the nation codifies its commitment to safeguarding its rich history for future generations.[1] This law establishes the framework for identifying, preserving, and protecting the tangible and intangible cultural assets of the Maldives.
Key Definitions and Scope

The law provides precise definitions for different categories of heritage:

    Cultural Heritage: Encompasses significant items, places, buildings, and areas linked to Maldivian customs, history, and the past. This includes movable, architectural, archaeological, and intangible heritage.

    Movable Cultural Heritage: Refers to portable items of social, literary, artistic, historical, or archaeological importance to the Maldives due to their connection to the nation's past, culture, and traditions. This can range from artifacts found on land or sea to items associated with national figures and events, artistic creations, and audio-visual materials.

    Archaeological Building: A structure notable for its historical, scientific, or artistic value, showcasing the art of construction linked to the nation's culture, history, and customs.

    Archaeological Site: An area of historical, scientific, or artistic significance, including sites marked by human craftsmanship or the interplay of human and natural influences.

    Intangible Cultural Heritage: Includes traditions, language, and knowledge passed down through generations. This is expressed through Maldivian customs, the Dhivehi language and its dialects, literature, traditional arts, social practices, and craftsmanship.

Administration and Governance

The "National Centre for Cultural Heritage" is designated as the primary body for the law's implementation.[2][3] This center, formerly the Department of Heritage, is responsible for creating and maintaining a register of cultural heritage, providing guidance to local councils, and regulating activities related to heritage sites.[2][3] The Minister of Arts, Culture, and Heritage is tasked with setting policies in consultation with the President.

A significant component of the law is the establishment of the Heritage Trust Fund. This fund will finance preservation activities through government allocations, donations, and fees from heritage sites. A nine-member board, chaired by the Minister of Arts, Culture, and Heritage, will manage the fund.
Registration and Protection

The law outlines a detailed process for registering cultural heritage, which includes:

    Movable Cultural Heritage: Items are eligible if they possess significant cultural value and are over 75 years old, or if they have significant cultural value regardless of age.

    Archaeological Sites and Buildings: Registered based on their significant cultural value.

    Intangible Cultural Heritage: Registered if it possesses significant intangible cultural value.

The public and local councils can propose items and sites for registration. The law also mandates procedures for newly discovered items or sites, requiring that finds be reported to the local council within 48 hours, which then informs the National Centre for Cultural Heritage.

Protection measures are robust, prohibiting the export of registered movable cultural heritage without a permit. The law also allows for the designation of "Protected Areas" around archaeological sites, where activities are restricted.
Responsibilities and Penalties

The law places a shared responsibility on government institutions and the public to protect cultural heritage. Government bodies must align their policies with the heritage law, and educational institutions are encouraged to incorporate Maldivian cultural heritage into their curricula.

Local councils are responsible for the protection and maintenance of heritage sites within their jurisdiction, with technical and financial support from the National Centre for Cultural Heritage. Every citizen and visitor has a duty to help preserve the nation's heritage.

The law criminalizes acts that damage, destroy, or alter cultural heritage.[4] Penalties include fines ranging from MVR 10,000 to MVR 1,000,000, and may include further criminal proceedings under the Maldives' Penal Code.

This legislation supersedes the previous law on historical and archaeological sites (Law No. 27/79) and marks a comprehensive effort by the Maldives to protect its unique cultural identity.[5]
