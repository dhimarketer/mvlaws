This Act is a special law enacted to determine the course of action for councils in the decentralized administration of the administrative divisions of the Maldives during the transitional period following the expiration of the term of the currently elected councils on June 3, 2020. This is in accordance with Article 231 (k) of the Constitution of the Republic of Maldives. The Local Council Elections 2020, which were scheduled to be held in the Maldives, have been postponed until a safe environment for conducting the election can be established, as stipulated by the Special Act on Local Council Elections 2020 (Act No. 3/2020).

These measures include numerous steps to prevent the spread of the disease within the community.
