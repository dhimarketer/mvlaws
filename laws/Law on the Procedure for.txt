Law on the Procedure for Failure to Take Custody of Goods or Money That Must Be Handed Over

    In relation to various cases, after giving a period of 7 days for the rightful party to take custody of money paid by different parties, if that party does not take custody of the money, it shall be deposited and kept in a bank deposit account. Money deposited in this manner can only be withdrawn by the rightful party after a period of 1 year from when they request it. Any interest earned on such money shall be paid by the Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs or the High Court of the Maldives to the Treasury Division of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Anything received as interest shall not be released to the rightful recipient of the money.

    If the items to be taken into custody are things like trees and plants, a reasonable period shall be given, and if they are not taken into custody within that period, arrangements shall be made for the island's office to look after such trees and plants and for any produce from them to be received by the island's office until the rightful party takes custody of the items.

    If the item to be taken into custody is goods or property, after giving a reasonable period, and if they are not taken into custody within that period, those items or that property shall be sold at auction, and the money received shall be dealt with in accordance with the procedure stated in number 1.

Note:

A "reasonable period" shall be considered 1 month for items such as trees and plants. If it is goods or property located within the Maldives, it is also 1 month. For goods or property located outside the Maldives, it is 1 month from the date the goods or property are brought into the country. If it is something that requires going to take custody of, the period is 3 months.
