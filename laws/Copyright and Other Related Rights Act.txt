Being an Original Work

Copyright Registration
7.
(a) To obtain copyright protection under this Act, registration of such rights with a government authority is not mandatory. However, a party wishing to register such rights may register them at the Ministry.
(b) Notwithstanding the opportunity for copyright registration as provided for in subsection (a) of this Article, no prejudice shall be caused to the rights of unregistered copyrights.

Copyrighted Work to be in a Tangible Form
8.
(a) Works that can be copyrighted under this Act must be embodied in some tangible form. However, the condition stated in this Article shall not hinder the rights of performers as stated in Chapter 2 of this Act.
(b) Since programs automatically copied by a computer for the purpose of computer repair and maintenance are not considered to be embodied in a tangible form, this shall not be considered under this Act as an act that infringes upon a copyright.
(c) For the purpose of proving in a court of law that a work is their own creation, a party who does not opt for copyright registration as stated in this Act may, after putting the work into a tangible form, send it to their own address via registered post. However, such a self-sent envelope will be accepted as evidence in a court of law only if the envelope remains unopened and the date of posting is visible on it.
