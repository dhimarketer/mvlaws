**General Provisions**

**Purpose of the Act**

**2.**

(a) The main purpose of this Act is to establish banking principles and to ensure that the Maldivian banking system operates in accordance with these principles in order to achieve the following:

> (1) To maintain the stability of the banking system and to sustain public confidence in the banking system.
>
> (2) To protect the rights of bank depositors and creditors.
>
> (3) To prepare for and take appropriate measures against matters that may adversely affect the banking system.
>
> (4) To prevent financial crimes.
>
> (5) To broaden the competitiveness of the banking system in the Maldives and to make the banking system one that provides banking services in line with public needs and facilitates the economic progress of the Maldives.

(b) This Act shall be enforced and administered by the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA).

**Prohibited Activities**

**3.**

(a) It is prohibited for any party other than one licensed by the MMA to conduct banking business in the Maldives, to advertise the taking of money as deposits, or to carry out any activity for which a license is required under Article 4 of this Act. However, the MMA has the power to grant an exemption from these matters to the following parties:

> (1) An exemption from the prohibited activities mentioned in subsection (a) of this Article may be granted, in accordance with regulations made under this Act, considering the nature and scale of the business of such a party. Such exemptions may be granted for a specific period or until a specific task is completed. Even if such an exemption is granted, specific articles of this Act that such parties must comply with may be determined. Exemptions granted under this Article may be revoked by the MMA at any time. Or, the MMA may impose additional conditions on these exemptions at any time.
>
> (2) Leasing companies may be granted such an exemption as mentioned above if the MMA determines that the business of leasing companies is conducted under another legal framework that protects the rights of the public. The MMA has the right to impose additional conditions on exemptions so granted or to revoke the exemptions.

(b) Parties granted an exemption by the MMA under this Article shall be notified in writing of the fact that an exemption has been granted, stating the reason for the exemption. These reasons shall be published in the Government Gazette.

(c) No party other than one licensed by the MMA to conduct banking business shall use the word "bank" or a related word or another word conveying the meaning of this word, in Dhivehi or any other language, in business or in providing services. When a party other than one licensed by the MMA to conduct banking business applies for permission to use the word "bank" or a related word or another word conveying its meaning, the MMA may grant that party permission to use that word if it is of the opinion that its use will not cause harm to the public, or that its use will not imply to the public that it is a banking service.

(d) If the MMA becomes aware of a reason to believe that any party is conducting an activity prohibited under the preceding parts of this Article, the MMA has the power to go to the business premises of such a party or to have their books and accounts brought and inspect them. And upon a request from the MMA to the Maldives Police Service to enter the business premises of a party believed to be conducting such an act to inspect their books and accounts, or to bring their books and accounts to the MMA, the Maldives Police Service shall immediately provide assistance to the MMA, even by using force, to carry out these actions.

#### **Chapter Four**
**Capital**

**Minimum Capital to be Maintained by a Domestic Bank, Tier 1 Bank, and Tier 2 Bank**

**12.**

(a) A domestic bank may be established as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 bank, by paying the prescribed capital in Maldivian Rufiyaa in a manner that is unencumbered by any third-party claims, and in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

> (1) A Tier 1 bank shall at all times maintain a minimum unimpaired paid-up capital of not less than MVR 150,000,000 (one hundred fifty million), or a higher amount if specified by the MMA. A Tier 1 bank may conduct the banking activities specified in Article 25 of this Act. However, activities shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Article 25(b).
>
> (2) A Tier 2 bank shall at all times maintain a minimum unimpaired paid-up capital of not less than MVR 60,000,000 (sixty million), or a higher amount if specified by the MMA. The only business that a Tier 2 bank may conduct is the deposit-taking activity mentioned in Article 25(a)(1), consumer lending, trade finance, and mortgage lending, including only those types of loans specifically permitted by the MMA.

(b) Unless otherwise stated in this Act, Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks shall comply with all articles of this Act applicable to banks. A Tier 2 bank may apply to the MMA for a Tier 1 bank license if it maintains the unimpaired paid-up capital amount specified in subsection (a)(1) of this Article, or a higher amount if specified by the MMA, and fulfills all other conditions required for the establishment of a bank under this Act. The MMA may establish procedures for such an application.

(c) After making the necessary adjustments to the bank's profit for the past year under this Act and regulations made by the MMA, an amount may be determined for distribution to shareholders from that year's profit. However, distribution to shareholders from the profits of previous years can only be decided after obtaining permission from the MMA. No bank shall decide to distribute or distribute funds to shareholders, or give any type of money to shareholders, in a manner that would cause its capital and reserves to fall below the minimum required capital and reserves under this Act or a regulation or order of the MMA. Furthermore, no part of a bank's profit shall be transferred in a manner that would cause such a reduction in capital and reserves.

(d) Every bank shall establish a reserve to increase its capital and shall transfer to this reserve at least 50% (fifty percent) of its net profit after tax each year. This shall continue until this reserve is equal to one-half of the bank's paid-up capital. Thereafter, at least 25% (twenty-five percent) of the bank's net profit after tax each year shall be transferred to this reserve until the reserve is equal to the bank's paid-up capital. No bank shall reduce its capital, and the reserves maintained to supplement the capital as stated in this Article or otherwise, except after obtaining the permission of the MMA.

(e) No bank shall issue subordinated debt or repay any part of the principal or interest of subordinated debt except after obtaining the permission of the MMA.

**Assigned Capital for Branches of Foreign Banks; Difference Between Assets and Liabilities in the Maldives; Method of Calculating Bank Prudential Ratios**

**13.**

(a) A foreign bank operating in the Maldives shall maintain as capital an amount from its equity capital equivalent to the paid-up capital required for a domestic bank, for all its operations in the Maldives. The capital so maintained is the assigned capital of that branch. Branches of foreign banks designated to operate as Tier 1 banks shall maintain assigned capital equivalent to the amount of unimpaired capital required for a Tier 1 bank. Branches of foreign banks designated to operate as Tier 2 banks shall maintain assigned capital equivalent to the amount of unimpaired capital required for a Tier 2 bank. To increase the assigned capital, a portion of the branch's profit shall be transferred to a reserve account as stated in Article 12(d) of this Act. Assigned capital shall be maintained in accordance with instructions issued by the MMA.

(b) When the MMA determines and notifies the level by which the assets of each branch of a foreign bank operating in the Maldives must exceed its liabilities, assets must be maintained in the Maldives at that level.

(c) The ratios to be maintained by a branch of a foreign bank, including matters mentioned in Chapter 6 of this Act and capital-related ratios, shall be determined based on the assigned capital of those branches.

**How Capital Adequacy Standards Should be Maintained**

**14.**

(a) Every bank shall at all times maintain a total capital of not less than 12% (twelve percent) of its total risk-adjusted assets, and the core capital component of the capital shall be maintained at not less than 6% (six percent) of the total risk-adjusted assets. And at all times, the bank's capital shall be maintained at not less than 5% (five percent) of the bank's total assets. The MMA shall, in accordance with international standards, define capital, core capital, capital base, and other such terms and phrases, and specify the types of risk assets, and shall establish regulations. The MMA has the power, if it deems necessary, to set higher capital ratios than those mentioned in this Article.

(b) In calculating the capital-related ratios of a bank mentioned in subsection (a) of this Article, if any of its funds are included in the capital of another bank, that amount shall be deducted from the capital of the first-mentioned bank.

(c) The MMA shall establish a regulation specifying how a bank's minimum paid-up capital is to be established and maintained.

(d) The MMA has the power to order a bank to increase its capital-related ratios above the generally required level, if it deems it necessary considering the bank's management and financial condition.

(h) A meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held at least once every calendar month. At each such meeting, the minutes of the last meeting shall be reviewed and approved.

**Change of Bank Ownership and Becoming a Major Shareholder**

**20.**

(a) If any person intends to acquire shares, directly or indirectly, or through another person, to an extent that would make them a major shareholder of a bank, they must obtain the permission of the MMA before acquiring such shares. It shall be deemed that a person is acquiring shares through another person or persons if they act together under a formal or informal agreement, in a manner acceptable to the MMA, to acquire voting power in a bank.

(b) When applying for the permission mentioned in subsection (a) of this Article, the following information must be submitted:

> (1) The name, nationality, permanent address, and occupation or employment of the shareholder proposing to become a major shareholder, and a statement signed by that person attesting to its truth, indicating their financial situation.

The MMA shall not grant such permission if it believes that granting permission to a party applying for it as mentioned in subsection (a) of this Article would reduce competition in the banking sector, or cause a decline in the financial condition of that bank, or that the rights of depositors cannot be adequately protected.

(d) Any major shareholder of a bank must obtain the permission of the MMA before increasing their shareholding, directly or indirectly, or through another person or persons, to an extent that would exceed 20% (twenty percent), or 33% (thirty-three percent), or 50% (fifty percent) of the bank's capital or voting shares. The MMA may request that party to submit all or some of the information mentioned in subsection (b) of this Article. And the MMA has the power not to grant such permission if it believes that a condition mentioned in subsection (c) of this Article is not met in the application for permission.

(e) A person who does not meet the criteria to become a major shareholder of a newly proposed bank will also not meet the criteria to become a major shareholder of an existing bank.

(f) When a bank is notified that any person intends to acquire its shares as per subsections (a) and (d) of this Article, the bank must inform the MMA without delay.

(g) The MMA shall, within 90 (ninety) days of the submission of the information mentioned in subsections (b) or (d) of this Article in connection with an application for permission under subsections (a) or (d), notify whether permission has been granted or denied for that application. If the MMA has not provided a response within this period, it shall be deemed that permission has been granted for the application. If the MMA decides not to grant permission for such an application, it shall inform the party in writing of the reason for the decision.

**Merger of a Bank with Another Bank or Banks**

(a) One bank shall not merge with another bank except with the permission of the MMA.

And in connection with such an application, the information requested by the MMA must be submitted to the MMA.

(c) The MMA shall consider the financial and managerial capacity and future business prospects of the banks proposing to merge and the resulting bank after the merger. And the MMA shall not grant permission for such a proposal unless the resulting bank would meet all the conditions required for a license if it were applying for a new bank license. Furthermore, if the MMA believes that granting such permission would reduce competition in the banking sector, permission shall not be granted. However, if the MMA believes that the positive impact of granting such permission outweighs the negative impact of reduced competition, the permission may be granted.

**Audit Committee**

**22.**

(a) Every bank shall establish an Audit Committee. This committee shall meet at least 4 (four) times a year. The Audit Committee shall be a committee selected from within the Board of Directors. The powers and responsibilities of this committee are stated below:

However, such permission is not required for activities involving the buying and selling of foreign currency and money market instruments as mentioned in subsection (a)(3) of this Article. In granting permission for applications, the MMA shall consider the following:

> (1) The applicant's financial and managerial capacity, the level of relevant information, risk management procedures, and other factors necessary to conduct the proposed activities properly and soundly;
>
> (2) The potential for the rights of its depositors and creditors to be undermined by conducting the activities for which permission is sought; and

> (3) If the MMA sees an opportunity to increase competition in the financial sector and benefit the public by conducting the proposed activities as proposed, additional conditions may be set for granting permission for the proposed activities.

(c) The MMA may, if it deems necessary, order banks to conduct certain services through a separate subsidiary with a separate capital, in which the bank holds more than 50% (fifty percent) of the shares, in accordance with conditions set by the MMA.

(d) The MMA may, if it deems necessary, grant permission to provide a permitted banking service or activity to customers electronically via computer, internet, or any other means.

>
> (2) In a manner that provides adequate security for customers, the bank, and other parties;

And if it is not believed that it will have an adverse effect on the bank, the entire banking system, and the payment system. The MMA has the power to establish regulations regarding the provision of banking services electronically.

(f) The power to determine which activities a bank may conduct and under what conditions or principles permitted activities may be conducted rests solely with the MMA.

**Prohibited Activities**

**26.**

(a) No bank shall engage in wholesale or retail trade, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, fisheries, mining, construction, insurance underwriting, or any business activity other than those specified in Article 25 of this Act. And it shall not participate in any of these activities as an agent for another party, as a partner with another party, or as a business associate with another party. However, after obtaining written permission from the MMA, any of these activities may be carried out temporarily to recover a previously issued debt. In the permission granted by the MMA, a date by which the permitted activity must cease may be specified.

The policies formulated or principles established by the bank in this regard must be in accordance with Article 24 of this Act, and if the MMA has made regulations and instructions under that Article, in accordance with such regulations and instructions, and if the MMA has made regulations under subsection (b) of this Article, also in accordance with those regulations. In particular, the bank shall establish and adhere to policies or principles regarding the following matters and prudential ratios indicating the bank's soundness or condition:

> (1) The required level of the bank's liquid assets or items in relation to its liabilities, or in relation to the value or change in value of its assets, including guarantees received and collateral taken by the bank.

(b) The MMA shall issue regulations including principles on capital adequacy standards, asset classification, cessation of interest accrual on loans, loan loss provisioning, limits on large exposures to a single party, limits on exposures to connected parties, transactions with related parties, foreign exchange open position limits, limits on deposits with other banks, liquidity management, and other important matters for the sound and safe operation of a bank. The MMA may, in special circumstances, determine the interest rates, maturity dates, and other aspects of various types of funds issued or received by a bank, including deposits, and contingent liabilities.

(c) A bank must obtain the permission of the MMA before entering into a management contract and before obtaining advisory or consulting services that would transfer the responsibilities and duties of the bank's Board of Directors and executive officers to another party.

**Credit Exposure Limits**

**28.**

(a) The maximum credit exposure a bank can maintain shall be an amount determined in a regulation made by the MMA under this Act. And such a regulation may determine the following:

> (1) The maximum credit exposure that can be maintained for a single party or for connected parties that are to be considered as a single party under a regulation made by the MMA under this Act;
>
> (2) The maximum credit exposure that can be maintained for a corporate group as defined under a regulation made by the MMA under this Act;
>
> (3) The maximum aggregate amount of all exposures defined as large exposures under a regulation made by the MMA under this Act.

(b) Credit granted directly to the government, or credit granted to a government ministry or agency, or credit for which the principal and interest are unconditionally guaranteed by the government, shall be exempt from subsection (a) of this Article. It shall also be exempt from Article 29 of this Act.

(c) For the purpose of this Article or regulations formulated by the MMA, the MMA may, in a regulation, determine the circumstances in which credit granted to one party will be attributed to another party or in which credit granted to one party will be considered as credit granted jointly with another party. These circumstances shall be determined based on how the credit funds will be used and how the funds for repayment to the bank will be sourced. The MMA may also determine, in individual cases, circumstances in which credits granted to different parties may be aggregated.

**Loans to Related Parties**

**29.**

(a) A bank may grant a loan to any party defined as a related party in a regulation made by the MMA under this Act only if the following conditions are met:

> (1) The loan and its terms are approved by a two-thirds majority of the Board of Directors. For foreign banks, such loans must be approved by the appointed branch manager. However, loans granted under an employee benefit scheme as mentioned in subsection (a)(3) of this Article are exempt from this condition. This exemption applies only if the loan amount does not exceed an amount determined as exempt by a regulation formulated by the MMA.
>
> (2) The loan amount must not exceed the maximum amount that can be maintained as a loan to a related party under a regulation made by the MMA. Such regulations formulated by the MMA may determine the maximum amount of credit a bank can extend to a related party, the aggregate maximum amount that can be extended to all related parties, the terms of the loans, repayment terms, the service fee or interest rate to be charged, the collateral for such loans, and the principles and rules concerning these matters. The MMA may also, in the regulations it formulates, specify other debts that must be aggregated with the debt owed to the bank by related parties.
>
> (3) The terms of the loan shall not be more favorable than the terms of loans generally offered by the bank to the public. However, the service fee or interest rate on loans granted to employees of the bank, other than directors, under a scheme that is consistent with the regulations formulated by the MMA regarding lending to related parties, approved by the Board of Directors, and applicable to all employees, may be reduced. This scheme must be one that has received written approval from the MMA.

(b) In applying the standards in this Article and the standards determined under regulations formulated by the MMA, the MMA may, in individual cases, determine that a party is a related party to a bank due to its relationship with the bank, and that two parties are connected parties due to the relationship between a related party and another party.

(c) A director, officer, or employee who knowingly authorizes or participates in the authorization of a loan that violates this Article, Article 28 of this Act, or regulations formulated by the MMA, shall be jointly and severally liable for the lesser of the following two amounts:

> (1) The loss incurred by the bank as a result of the loan; or
>
> (2) The amount of the loan granted in excess of the limit specified in this Article, Article 28 of this Act, or a regulation made by the MMA under this Act.

And the above-mentioned parties shall be liable for the said amount until all the funds of the loan and all other funds owed to the bank by the borrower have been fully repaid.

(d) In calculating the ratios mentioned in Article 14(a) of this Act, the MMA may, if it deems necessary, order a bank to deduct a loan granted to a related party from the bank's capital. The MMA may also order banks not to grant loans to related parties unless the entire loan is secured by a readily marketable asset. And in granting such loans, if readily marketable collateral and securing the entire loan are defined by the MMA in a regulation or otherwise, banks must comply with it.

(e) Any service obtained from, or asset purchased or leased from, a related party must be in accordance with regulations formulated by the MMA. And before obtaining such a service, or purchasing or leasing such an asset, it must be approved by the Board of Directors or the appointed branch manager, as stated in subsection (a)(1) of this Article. And such a transaction with a related party must be conducted in a manner that is not detrimental to the bank when compared to the principles and terms under which the bank would conduct such a transaction with a non-related party.

**Open Position of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities**

**30.**

The MMA may make regulations determining and specifying the limits for the open position of foreign currency assets and liabilities that banks must generally maintain, or the limits for the open position of specific types of foreign currency assets and liabilities.

**Investment Methods**

**31.**

(a) No bank shall invest in a commercial or industrial company except as provided in this Article. However, this Article does not prevent an Islamic bank or a bank providing services in accordance with Islamic banking principles from providing financing in accordance with the regulations and principles established by the MMA.

(b) A bank shall not invest more than 15% (fifteen percent) of its capital in the stock, bonds, shares, or equity-linked bonds of another company. In this regard, if investing in a company other than a company conducting banking services, the investment shall not exceed 5% (five percent) of the voting shares of that company.

(c) A bank shall not acquire more than 5% (five percent) of the voting shares of another bank or financial institution except with the permission of the MMA.

(d) A bank shall not purchase or hold land or buildings in its name except for the following purposes:

> (1) For the residence of the bank's employees or for conducting the bank's business activities;
>
> (2) To purchase land or buildings necessary for providing Islamic banking services in accordance with the regulations and principles established by the MMA; and
>
> (3) To temporarily hold land or buildings acquired through the enforcement of a mortgage until they can be sold.

(e) If a bank, in the course of its banking business, has made any type of investment related to the ownership of a company or financial institution in excess of the limits specified in this Article, such investment must be brought within the limits specified in this Article within 6 (six) months of making it. However, if the bank requests an extension for a valid reason, the MMA may grant an extension not exceeding an additional 6 (six) months. Land or buildings acquired by a bank in the course of its banking business in violation of the limits permitted in this Article must be brought within the limits specified in this Article within 2 (two) years of their acquisition. However, if the bank requests an extension for a valid reason, the MMA may grant an extension not exceeding an additional 2 (two) years.

**Bank Holidays**

**32.**

All banks shall remain open to provide services to the public on the days and during the hours determined by the MMA as minimum opening hours, except on bank holidays determined by the MMA. The MMA may permit a bank to open on days and during hours other than those determined by the MMA as minimum opening hours. Without such permission, no bank shall provide services to the public on a bank holiday determined by the MMA. In a situation where a bank's services must be temporarily suspended, the MMA may permit or order that bank to be temporarily closed and to reopen on a date determined by the MMA.

**Suspicious Transactions**

**33.**

Disclosure of information by a bank in good faith under this Article shall not be considered a disclosure of a secret that the bank is required to maintain. And the bank and the MMA shall not be held responsible for any matter that may arise from such a disclosure.

**Lending Against Bank's Own Shares and Repurchase of Bank's Shares**

**34.**

A bank shall not grant a loan or a bank guarantee to a party if the collateral for the loan is that party's own shares in the bank. And a bank shall not repurchase its own shares from the shareholder without obtaining the permission of the MMA. However, to avert a loss arising in connection with a previously granted loan, the bank's shares may be taken as collateral for such a loan. Shares held as collateral in this manner must be sold off in accordance with the regulations formulated by the MMA. In calculating a bank's minimum required capital and capital adequacy ratios, a bank's own shares held by it and loans granted against the bank's shares as collateral shall be deducted from the capital.

**Dormant Accounts**

**35.**

If an account opened in any bank is an account in which no transaction has been made for a continuous period of 5 (five) years, that account shall be declared a dormant account, and the bank shall act in respect of that account as follows. However, this Article does not prevent banks from determining, in a manner not inconsistent with this Act, procedures for dealing with accounts in which no transaction has been made for a period shorter than this.

(a) If the owner of an account has not made any transaction in that account for a continuous period of 5 (five) years, or has not sent any written communication to the bank, the bank shall, on the first official working day of the following year, send a letter by registered post to that person, addressed to their last known address with the bank, detailing the dormant account. The names of those who do not respond to such a letter shall be published in at least one daily newspaper and in the Government Gazette. If the owner of an account is not found within 60 (sixty) days of such publication, a detailed report on such an account shall be prepared and submitted to the MMA. And the deposit funds in such an account shall be handed over to the MMA to be kept in a special account at the MMA.

(b) The money handed over to the MMA by banks as per subsection (a) of this Article shall be kept by the MMA in a separate special account for investment in government securities. However, if within a period of 5 (five) years, the owner of the funds in this account comes forward with evidence acceptable to the MMA that they are the owner of the funds, they have the right to receive that money. And the money that has not been claimed within this period shall be handed over by the MMA to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Even after this money has been handed over to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury, if the owner of the money comes forward with evidence acceptable to the MMA that they are the owner of the funds, that person has the right to obtain that money from the Ministry of Finance and Treasury.

**Records**

**36.**

(a) The following documents shall be kept and filed in the Maldives by banks for the period prescribed by law or for a period determined by the MMA:

>
> (4) Account agreements made with customers.
>
> (5) Other documents required to be kept under regulations made by the MMA in this regard.

(b) Records shall be kept in written form. If there is a system for adequately securing and maintaining information and for retrieving information if it is lost, a bank may, instead of keeping the originals of required records, books, statements, papers, various written transactions, cables, notices, and other papers related to the bank's financial activities, keep them in a more convenient form, such as on microfilm, electronically, or by using other technological means, for the period determined under this Act. Records kept in such a convenient form can be used as evidence in courts just like their originals. The MMA may formulate a regulation detailing how records should be kept.

**Payments Systems and Credit Bureaus**

**37.**

(a) Cooperative systems, payment systems, settlement systems, and clearing systems required for the transfer of funds between banks and other financial institutions, for crediting and debiting accounts, for settling accounts, and for settling payment instruments may be established by banks or the MMA. The MMA may formulate the regulations and principles required for conducting these activities. And if the MMA orders a bank to participate in such a system established by the MMA, that bank must participate in it.

(b) To make better banking decisions, banks may establish credit bureaus or credit information exchange agencies to obtain and exchange among banks information regarding the financial situation of their customers and potential future customers. And if the MMA establishes such a credit bureau or agency, they must participate in it. Information shall be provided in this manner only among banks. Information can be provided to a party other than banks only in accordance with a regulation formulated by the MMA, if the party to whom the information is provided has a banking or business relationship with the person to whom the information pertains, or is attempting to establish such a relationship. To maintain banking secrecy and to prevent the unlawful disclosure of such information, such information shall be provided in accordance with the regulations formulated by the MMA under Article 66(c)(5) of this Act.

**Prohibition of Using the General Principle of Confidentiality Regarding Information about a Customer Obtained in Transactions**

**38.**

In submitting any information, document, or report required or ordered to be submitted under laws and regulations related to the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism, a bank shall not be excused under the principle of maintaining the confidentiality of information about a customer obtained in various types of business transactions with that customer, and under the general principle that various types of written and oral transactions with customers cannot be disclosed by the bank to any other party without their permission, and under the section on banking secrecy in Article 41 of this Act.

**Prohibition of Disclosing to Any Party that Information is Being or Has Been Submitted to the Financial Intelligence Unit**

(b) If a written objection is sent as stated above, the MMA shall, after considering the points raised against the appointment of the conservator in such a letter, decide whether the decision to appoint the conservator will stand or whether the appointment is revoked, stating the reason.

However, such a decision shall be made only if the MMA believes that by making such a decision, such deposits, investments, and the interest payable on them during the intended withholding period and before it, can be adequately protected. However, funds in fiduciary accounts shall not be withheld in this manner. In exceptional circumstances, the conservator may, with the permission of the MMA, release all or part of a deposit held in the name of an individual from the withheld funds to that individual.

Or, the Minister of Finance and Treasury may arrange for the funds required for these expenditures.

Such a transfer shall take effect immediately. If such a transfer does not include a right owed by the bank to some of its creditors, the conservator shall consider the interests of such creditors. And such a transfer does not require the permission of the bank or any party responsible for its management. The liabilities of the bank transferred in this manner shall be published in the Government Gazette and in a newspaper of general circulation as determined by the MMA.

(e) Upon the decision to declare a bank insolvent, encumbrances on the sale or transfer of the bank's assets, and attachments made to execute the bank's assets to satisfy the rights of the bank's creditors, shall be legally void. Attachments made after the decision to declare a bank insolvent are void. However, this does not include the attachment and execution of an asset pledged for a debt of the bank, up to the amount of that debt, in accordance with Article 102 of this Act.

(f) Upon the commencement of the decision to declare a bank insolvent, the accrual of interest or any other charge on the bank's liabilities shall cease.

(g) After the commencement of the decision to declare a bank insolvent, any transfer of shares other than a transfer made with the permission of the MMA shall be void.

(h) If legally permissible measures taken by a bank within a period of 90 (ninety) days prior to the date of the decision to declare the bank insolvent were taken when the bank and the counterparty to those measures knew or should have known that those measures could prejudice the interests of the bank's creditors, the MMA shall, upon a proposal from the receiver to void those measures, decide that those measures are void. A measure shall be deemed to have been taken with the knowledge or in circumstances where it should have been known that it could prejudice the interests of the bank's creditors if one of the following occurred at the time of or in the course of taking that measure:

> (1) A gift or other transfer was made to any person without value or consideration;
>
> (2) A payment or transfer was made to an owner, administrator, or employee of the bank. However, if that person proves to the court that such payment or transfer was made in connection with their employment at the bank or in connection with their account at the bank, and that the amount of the payment or transfer was not unusually large, or that they did not know that the payment or transfer could prejudice the interests of the bank's creditors, that measure shall not be deemed to have been taken with the knowledge or in circumstances where it should have been known that it would prejudice the interests of the bank's creditors;
>
> (3) A payment or transfer was made before the due date, or collateral for a debt was returned before the debt matured;

>
> (5) An agreement was entered into between the bank and another party or parties permitting the set-off of the bank's rights and responsibilities, other than an eligible financial contract as specified in Article 99 of this Act; and such an agreement must be one that, without it, would not have permitted the set-off of the bank's rights and responsibilities before the decision to declare the bank insolvent.
>
> (6) A transfer was made between a domestic branch of a foreign bank and that foreign bank or its branches or subsidiaries in other countries.

**Transactions within a Money or Security Settlement System**

**94.**

(a) Notwithstanding that certain transactions are declared void under Articles 72(d), 80(b)(1), 93(k), and 93(h)(2) and (3) of this Act, the validity of transactions made within a payment and security settlement system shall be determined as follows:

> (1) Even if a court has decided to declare a bank insolvent, money and security transfer orders that a bank has irrevocably entered into a payment or security settlement system accepted by the MMA are legally enforceable and binding on third parties. However, these orders shall be considered legally enforceable and binding on third parties only if they became irrevocable before the decision to declare the bank insolvent came into effect.
>
> (2) If money and security transfer orders that a bank has irrevocably entered into a payment or security settlement system were entered after the court's decision to declare the bank insolvent came into effect, those orders shall be legally enforceable and binding on a third party only if the orders were made on the day the court decided to declare the bank insolvent. However, if the receiver proves that the operator of the payment or security settlement system knew that the bank had been declared insolvent before the orders became irrevocable, those orders are not legally enforceable and binding on a third party.

(b) A decision made under a payment or security settlement system accepted by the MMA shall not be affected by any law, regulation, or practice that invalidates agreements and transactions made by a bank before the court's decision to declare it insolvent comes into effect, except as provided in Article 94 of this Act.

(c) For the purpose of this Article, transfer orders entered into a system shall become irrevocable from the time specified in the rules of the payment or security settlement system as the time when a transfer order becomes irrevocable.

**Transfer of Bank's Shares, and Assets and Liabilities**

**95.**

(a) To maintain the stability of the banking system and to enhance the value of a bank for the benefit of its creditors, if the receiver and the MMA determine that it is necessary to conduct one or more of the transactions specified in subsections (1) and (2) of this Article, the receiver shall notify the court of the proposed transaction to obtain permission.

> (1) Transfer of all or a substantial part of the bank's shares; or
>
> (2) Transfer of all or a substantial part of the bank's assets, or transfer of all or a substantial part of the bank's liabilities, or transfer of all of the bank's assets and all of its liabilities, or transfer of a substantial part of its assets and liabilities.

(c) A transaction specified in subsection (a) of this Article may be proposed at any time from the filing of the petition for the bank's bankruptcy until the bank is wound up.

(d) To conduct a transaction specified in subsection (a) of this Article, the permission of the bank or a party responsible for its management is not required. In granting permission for a proposal by the receiver to transfer part of the bank's liabilities, if the proposal does not include a right owed by the bank to some of its creditors, the court shall consider the interests of such creditors. The transfer of liabilities shall take effect at the beginning of the day following the day of its publication in the Government Gazette.

**Report on the Bank's Property**

**96.**

(a) Within 30 (thirty) days of the appointment of the receiver, or within an extended period if granted by the MMA, the receiver shall prepare a report on the property owned by the bank and submit it to the MMA. This report shall include the following:

**Registration of Claims**

**97.**

(a) Within 60 (sixty) days from the date of publication in the Government Gazette of the court's decision to declare a bank insolvent, any person wishing to file a claim for money from the insolvent bank, except for the claims specified in Articles 98(a) and (b) of this Act, shall submit a written claim to the receiver appointed for that bank and register the claim. However, if 3 (three) or more of the bank's creditors apply to the court for an extension of this period at least 10 (ten) days before its expiry, the court may, for the purpose of treating all creditors equally, grant a one-time extension of this period by 30 (thirty) days for all creditors.

(b) Claims shall be registered with the following information and documentary evidence:

> (1) The name and address of the creditor;
>
> (2) The interest and other charges included in the claimed amount, and the amount of any penalty and tax due; and

(c) Upon the court's decision to declare a bank insolvent, the deposit funds shown in the bank's books and records as belonging to depositors shall be withheld from being released to the depositors. However, to mitigate the hardship that depositors may face as a result of this withholding, and as provided in Article 108 of this Act, the receiver has the power to release to depositors the funds required to meet their living expenses.

(d) After registering a claim submitted by a creditor, the receiver shall give a written confirmation of registration to that party. The document so given shall be considered as proof of the registration of that claim.

**Acceptance of Claims**

**98.**

(a) Claims for money shall be accepted by the bank only if they are registered as specified in Article 97 of this Act. However, claims for deposits shown in the bank's books and records shall be accepted up to the amount shown in the records without registration.

(b) Among the registered claims for money, claims that are shown as payable in the bank's books and records shall be accepted by the receiver up to the amount shown in the bank's records, without further evidence. However, claims registered for an amount less than the amount shown in the bank's records shall be accepted for the amount stated in the claim.

(c) A claim submitted by a creditor of a bank to recover a loan granted to the bank against a bank asset as collateral shall be registered only for the difference if the estimated proceeds from the sale of the pledged asset in a public auction are less than the loan amount. Such a registered claim shall be accepted only after the asset has been auctioned, or if the ownership of the asset has been transferred under Article 102 of this Act.

(d) If the receiver is uncertain about the amount claimed, the claim may be accepted for an amount that the receiver estimates as the value of the claim.

(e) After reviewing the registered claims, the claims accepted by the receiver shall be recorded in a list of accepted claims. And the claims that the receiver refuses to accept shall be recorded in a list of rejected claims, stating the reason for rejecting the claim. If part of a registered claim is rejected, the rejected part shall be recorded in the list of rejected claims, and the accepted part shall be recorded in the list of accepted claims. Both lists shall state the name and address of the claimant, the amount of money claimed, and whether the claimed money is secured by collateral or not. The claims shall be listed in the order of priority for payment.

(f) Within 30 (thirty) days from the expiry of the period for registering claims against the bank, the two lists mentioned in subsection (e) of this Article shall be prepared and submitted to the court for approval.

Before approving the lists, the court may, after consulting with the receiver, transfer a claim from one list to the other. The court may determine the evidence required for the acceptance of rejected claims.

(g) Within 60 (sixty) days of the submission of the list of rejected claims to the court, the court shall set a date for the hearing of those claims. And the creditors who submitted those claims may present evidence to the court and the receiver to prove that their claims should be accepted. The receiver shall publish the date of the hearing in the Government Gazette and send a written notice to the creditor's address to inform the creditor of the date of the hearing. It is not necessary to send a written notice of the hearing date for the same claim to the creditor more than once. Upon the conclusion of such a hearing, the court shall decide whether to approve or reject the claim for payment. If a creditor, having been notified in writing of the date of the hearing, fails to attend the hearing, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by the court. The receiver shall inform the creditors whose claims have been rejected by the court in writing of the rejection.

(h) The decision of the court to approve a claim for payment is final. The claims approved for payment by the court, after being removed from the list of claims accepted by the receiver or the list of claims rejected by the receiver, shall be recorded in a list of claims approved for payment by the court. A copy of this list shall be kept with the receiver and at the court. The receiver shall inform the creditors whose claims have been approved for payment by the court in writing of the approval.

(i) The receiver shall not pay any claim that has been rejected for payment by the court. If a claim is rejected for payment by the court, the decision may be appealed to the High Court within 2 (two) weeks of the creditor receiving the written notification of the rejection.

**Set-off and Netting**

**99.**

(a) Unless otherwise stated in this Article, no article of this Act and no decision made under this Act shall prevent or prohibit the set-off of mutual legal obligations arising between the parties to agreements made with an insolvent bank. However, the receiver may prohibit the following:

> (1) A set-off between a loan owed to the bank and a deposit owed by the bank, if the receiver believes that such a set-off would unfairly prioritize the rights of some depositors over the rights of other depositors; and
>
> (2) A set-off from the deposits of the bank's directors, officers, and employees.

(b) In determining the financial obligations and rights between the parties to agreements made with an insolvent bank and the bank, the termination and netting provisions in the eligible financial agreements made between them shall be considered. The total amount payable upon the termination of an eligible financial agreement as specified in the agreement is a payment owed to the bank by the other party to the agreement (excluding the insolvent bank) or a payment that the other party has registered to claim and has been accepted by the bank as payable. In this Article, an [eligible financial agreement] refers to one of the following agreements:

> (1) A currency or interest rate swap agreement;
>
> (2) A basis swap agreement;
>
> (3) A spot, future, forward, or other foreign exchange agreement;

>
> (11) A master agreement related to an agreement specified in subsections (1) to (10) of this Article;
>
> (12) A master agreement related to a master agreement specified in subsection (11) of this Article;
>
> (13) A guarantee given for a payment due under an agreement specified in subsections (1) to (12) of this Article; and
>
> (14) Any agreement specified as an eligible financial agreement in a regulation formulated by the MMA;

(c) Except as provided in Article 94 of this Act, no set-off of a payment owed by a bank and a payment owed to the bank shall be made after the court's decision to declare the bank insolvent comes into effect. And except in this manner, no set-off of a payment owed by the bank or a payment owed to the bank arising from a transaction made in bad faith before the court's decision came into effect shall be made.

**Termination of Agreements**

**100.**

The receiver may, within a reasonable period not exceeding 60 (sixty) days from the date of the filing of the petition for the bank's bankruptcy, terminate all or some of the agreements made with a bank regarding the sale of goods and the provision of services. The agreements that may be terminated in this way include agreements for purchase and sale, rental and lease agreements, hire purchase agreements, and employment agreements. However, a party to the agreement or a beneficiary of the agreement may register a claim for compensation for the loss incurred due to the bank's breach of the agreement. The compensation for a claim registered in this way shall be paid only for the damages due up to the day the receiver terminated the agreement, and the interest accrued on such damages until the date of payment. The compensation given in this way shall include only direct damages. And it shall not include an amount exceeding the amount of the direct damages. And the compensation given in this way shall not include compensation for pain and suffering incurred as a result of the termination of the agreement, nor shall it include compensation for the loss of a prospective gain or opportunity.

**Reaching a Mutual Agreement**

**101.**

After obtaining the permission of the MMA, the receiver may, in consultation with creditors, decide on a settlement regarding the money owed by the bank to a creditor and the money owed to the bank by a debtor of the bank. A decision made in this way cannot be appealed or reviewed.

**Claims for Funds Borrowed from a Bank by Providing Security or Pledging Collateral**

**102.**

(a) If a claim submitted by a creditor to recover funds from a bank and approved is a claim for funds borrowed from the bank by providing an asset as security or by pledging it, the asset provided as security or pledged shall be sold in a commercially reasonable manner. And if the proceeds from the sale are sufficient to pay all the money owed to that creditor, upon payment of that money to that creditor, it shall be deemed that the money owed to that party has been fully paid. If the amount of money received from the sale of such an asset exceeds the amount approved for payment of the claim, that excess money shall be added to the bank's assets for payment to creditors as provided in Article 103 of this Act. If the amount of money received from the sale of an asset is less than the amount approved for payment of the claim, that shortfall shall be considered as money owed to unsecured creditors as mentioned in Article 103 of this Act. The receiver may, if they deem it appropriate, transfer the asset taken as security or collateral to the creditor in lieu of the payment due on the creditor's claim.

(b) If a loan taken from a bank by another party by providing an asset as security or by pledging it is a loan that is due or payable upon demand by the bank, or if the due date of the loan can be accelerated by the bank, upon a request from the receiver to hand over the asset provided as security or pledged, that asset shall be handed over to the receiver. And that asset shall be sold in a commercially reasonable manner. Or if the receiver wishes to take that asset for the purpose of the receivership, it may be taken. If the proceeds from the sale of the asset are sufficient to pay all the money owed to the bank, upon payment of that money to that bank, it shall be deemed that the money owed to the bank has been fully paid. If the amount of money received from the sale of the asset exceeds the amount of money owed to the bank, that excess money shall be handed over in full to the owner of the asset. If the amount of money received from the sale of the asset is less than the amount of money owed to the bank, a claim may be filed to recover that money from the party who owes it. An asset provided as security or pledged for a loan taken from a bank, for which the due date cannot be accelerated by the bank under the agreement between the parties, may be sold by the receiver even without the consent of that party.

(c) The sale of an asset in the following manner shall be deemed to have been sold in a commercially reasonable manner:

> (1) Selling readily marketable securities, foreign currency, and other assets in the market where that asset is traded; and
>
> (2) Selling the asset in a public auction. However, if the receiver believes that the asset cannot be sold at a reasonable price in such an auction, the MMA may authorize the receiver to sell it at a price approved by the MMA without an auction.

(d) If any disagreement arises between the receiver and a secured creditor regarding the value of an asset provided as security or pledged, such a disagreement shall be resolved by selling the asset in a public auction. The price at which the asset is sold in such a public auction shall be considered the final value of the asset.

(e) Except for the assets specified in subsection (c)(1) of this Article, a claim submitted by a creditor to recover funds borrowed from a bank by providing an asset as security or collateral may be paid without selling the asset provided as security or pledged in a public auction. In determining the payment to be made in such a case, a value determined by an independent party may be used.

**Order of Priority for Payments**

**103.**

The assets of an insolvent bank shall be distributed to its creditors in the following order of priority:

(a) The salaries and benefits of the bank's employees due up to the date the bank was declared insolvent, and the employees' provident fund contributions and other such funds payable by the bank within a period of 1 (one) year prior to the date the bank was declared insolvent. This does not include money owed to executive officers and directors;

(b) All costs of the bank's insolvency proceedings;

> (1) The bank's balance sheet prepared with the estimated value upon liquidation of the bank's assets and liabilities, and a projected balance sheet of the bank's assets and liabilities three months later. In preparing these balance sheets, the claims accepted by the receiver from among the claims filed by creditors, the rejected claims, and the claims approved by the court shall be included among the liabilities;
>

>
> (3) A report on the sale of the bank's major assets and a report on the planned sale of those assets;

>
> (5) A report on the irregular acts committed by the bank's administrators and the measures that can be taken to recover the losses incurred by the bank;

(b) The liquidation plan shall be updated once every quarter. The liquidation plan so prepared, upon approval by the MMA, shall be made available for inspection by the creditors whose claims have been approved under Article 98 of this Act.

**Recapitalization of an Insolvent Bank**

**105.**

(a) No insolvent bank shall be recapitalized, in whole or in part, using state funds, except as provided in Article 78 of this Act.

(b) An insolvent bank may be recapitalized using private funds. This may be done only if the major shareholders, directors, and executive officers of the bank are fit and proper persons, if the resulting bank after recapitalization would meet all the financial and other requirements for a newly opened bank, and if the recapitalization plan has been approved by the MMA.

**No Settlement with Creditors**

**106.**

Although Article 101 of this Act states that a settlement can be reached in consultation with creditors, no settlement shall be reached in consultation with a group of creditors of an insolvent bank.

**General Meetings and Creditors' Committee**

**107.**

(a) No general meeting of the creditors of an insolvent bank shall be held regarding the winding up of the bank, unless the MMA, at the request of the receiver, decides that holding a general meeting of the creditors of an insolvent bank will facilitate the sound progress of the winding-up process.

(b) No creditors' committee of an insolvent bank shall be formed, unless the MMA, at the request of the receiver, decides that the formation of a creditors' committee of an insolvent bank will represent one or more groups of the bank's creditors and protect their interests.

(c) The decision of the MMA to hold a general meeting of the creditors of an insolvent bank or to form a creditors' committee shall state the responsibilities and functions of the general meeting of the creditors or the creditors' committee.

**Immediate Payment to Depositors**

**108.**

Before making payments to the unsecured creditors of an insolvent bank, a payment may be made on a claim for a demand deposit or any other deposit held in that bank, other than as a debt security. The maximum that can be paid to a depositor in this manner is 50% (fifty percent) of their deposit.

**Making Payments**

**109.**

(a) The approved claims, from among the claims filed, shall be consolidated and divided into different classes, in accordance with the order of priority for payment as per Article 103 of this Act, and recorded in a payment schedule. Except for the payment made as provided in Article 108 of this Act, the amount of payment to be made for claims in the same class shall be determined by setting a certain percentage of the total funds in the bank, and all claims in the same class shall receive the same amount.

(b) In accordance with Article 103 of this Act and at any time, the receiver may prepare a schedule for paying the approved claims and submit it to the MMA for approval. The MMA may approve the schedule so submitted. If any party is dissatisfied with the amount of money scheduled to be paid for their claim, they may file a case in court under Article 67.

(c) Upon the MMA's approval of the schedule for paying the approved claims submitted by the receiver for the MMA's approval, the receiver shall disburse the funds for the claims listed in that schedule. The funds for claims that cannot be disbursed because the creditor listed in the schedule is unknown or cannot be contacted shall be deposited in an account at the MMA. The receiver shall publish the names of such creditors in the Government Gazette and in a newspaper of general circulation, requesting them to come and collect the funds. The funds so deposited at the MMA shall be kept at the MMA for a period of 10 (ten) years for payment to the creditors or their heirs or the rightful owner of the funds. After 10 (ten) years, this money shall be transferred to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Even after this money has been handed over to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury, if the owner of the money comes forward with evidence acceptable to the MMA that they are the owner of the funds, that person has the right to obtain that money from the Ministry of Finance and Treasury.

**Insolvency of a Bank Branch or Representative Office**

**110.**

(a) A petition for the insolvency of a domestic branch or representative office of a foreign bank may be filed for one of the following reasons:

In applying the articles of this chapter, the assets and liabilities of any such office of a foreign bank, and all acts done in connection with the conduct of business, and all acts omitted in the course of business or work, shall be deemed to be attributed to the aforesaid legal entity to which the office belongs. In taking measures against such a foreign bank, the conservator shall have all the powers vested in the authorized manager of a domestic bank or the shareholders at a general meeting of the shareholders of a bank.

(c) From the time the court decides to declare a domestic branch office of a foreign bank or a representative office of a foreign bank insolvent and notifies that office of the decision, the banking activities and services provided in the Maldives by the foreign bank to which that office belongs shall cease. The services or activities that must be ceased in this manner do not include the banking activities conducted and services provided by the receiver appointed for that office, and the banking activities conducted and services provided after obtaining the written permission of the receiver.

>
> (3) The court shall decide the extent to which decisions made outside the Maldives to declare a foreign bank insolvent, measures taken outside the Maldives to conserve a foreign bank, and measures taken outside the Maldives to recapitalize a foreign bank will apply to the domestic branch offices and representative offices of that foreign bank.
>
> (4) If the winding-up of a foreign bank is conducted in the country where its head office is located or where its business is mainly conducted, the MMA may, upon a request to the court to transfer the assets of that bank to its liquidator in that country, authorize the court to transfer the assets to the liquidator for the benefit of the bank's creditors and as advised by the MMA.

(b) The receiver or conservator appointed for a bank is the sole legal representative of that bank, its branches, offices, and subsidiaries, regardless of where they are established.

**112.**

Before the court decides to declare a bank insolvent, the court shall inform the MMA of its intended decision regarding that bank and shall give the MMA a reasonable opportunity to provide its advice on the matter. In making a decision on the insolvency of a bank, the court shall consider the advice given by the MMA.
