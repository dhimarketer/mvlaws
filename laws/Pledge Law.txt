Name

    This law shall be called the "Pledge Law".

Placing a Pledge

    In this law, placing a pledge refers to the act of providing an item that can be sold or leased to secure the rights of the lender in the event that a debt is not repaid. A pledge is any item placed in this manner.

Conditions for the Pledger and the Pledgee

    The person placing the pledge (pledger) and the person accepting the pledge (pledgee) must meet the following conditions:

    (a) Be at least 16 years of age.

    (b) Be of sound mind.

    (c) Be acting without duress.

    (d) The property must not be subject to seizure.

Pledgeable Items

    Any item that is permissible to be sold shall be permissible to be placed as a pledge.

Revocation

    The pledger is permitted to revoke the pledge before handing it over to the pledgee.

Compensation

    If the pledged property is damaged due to the negligence of the pledgee, the pledgee must provide compensation for it.

Reclaiming the Pledged Item

    Except with the willing consent of the pledgee, the pledged item, or any part of it, cannot be reclaimed until the debt is fully repaid.

Right to Sue

    If the pledger violates a condition or promise made regarding the pledge of a movable or immovable property in connection with a debt, the pledgee has the right to file a lawsuit in the relevant court.

Handing Over Pledged Property or its Rent to a Third Party

    If a claim filed under Article 8 of this law is proven in court, the court may order one of the following two actions:

    (a) Order the pledged property to be handed over to the pledgee.

    (b) If the property has been entrusted to another party in a manner that generates rent for the pledger, order that the rent due to the pledger be paid to the pledgee.

Duration of the Court Order

    If a pledged property is handed over to the pledgee in accordance with Article 9 of this law, that handover shall remain in effect, or if the rent due to the pledger is to be received by the pledgee, that arrangement shall remain in effect for a period determined by the court, or until the debt taken by the pledger is settled, or until the debt is fully repaid, or until the person who undertook to repay the debt has fully repaid it, or until the debt is forgiven.

Temporary Order

    Before a judgment is made in a case before the court, the court may issue a temporary order to prevent the pledger from selling, giving away, or otherwise disposing of the pledged movable or immovable property, or any part of it, in a manner that could cause any loss to the pledgee.

Sale of Pledged Property

    The court may order the sale of a pledged property brought before it with the permission of the pledger, or if there is no other way to repay the debt taken by the pledger, upon the request of one or more of the creditors.

Proceeds from the Sale of Pledged Property

    Neither of the concerned parties shall dispose of the money received from the sale of a property under Article 12 until the court makes a decision regarding it.
