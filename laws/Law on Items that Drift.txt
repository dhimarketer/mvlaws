Law on Items that Drift Ashore and Found Items

Introduction

    This is the law concerning items that drift ashore from the sea of the Maldives, and items found on the land and in the sea of the Maldives. This law shall be cited as the "Law on Items that Drift Ashore and Found Items".

Items that Drift Ashore

    With the exception of things that originate in the sea and items with a clearly known owner, all items that drift ashore from the sea of the Maldives are the property of the Government. Furthermore, even if the owner of an item that has drifted ashore from the sea of the Maldives is known, if another law stipulates a specific course of action concerning that item, the matter shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of that law.

Procedure for Items that Drift Ashore

    (a) If any item, excluding things that originate in the sea, is found having drifted ashore from the sea of the Maldives, the party who found it must without delay inform the Ministry of Finance and Treasury or the nearest Island Office or Atoll Office.

(b) If any item, excluding things that originate in the sea, is recovered from the sea of the Maldives, information regarding it must be reported without delay to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury or the nearest Island Office or Atoll Office. The found item must also be handed over to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury or a party designated by the Ministry, in accordance with a regulation made under this law.

Finding Items Originating in the Sea

    (a) Anyone who finds an item originating in the sea from within the territory of the Maldives must without delay inform, if in Malé, the Ministry of Finance and Treasury, and if in the atolls, the nearest Island Office or Atoll Office.

(b) Among found items, those originating in the sea shall be dealt with in accordance with a regulation made under this law.

Items Found in Other Places

    Anyone who finds an item in a place in the Maldives other than the sea must, within a period not exceeding 7 days from finding it, hand it over to the relevant court of the Ministry of Justice, if in Malé, and to the nearest island court, if in the atolls.

Handing Over Found Items to the Owner

    Among the found items mentioned in Article 3 and Article 5 of this law, the act of the finder handing over an item with a clearly known owner to its owner without delay shall be exempted from the provisions of Article 3 and Article 5.

Procedure for Items Brought In After Being Found

    (a) If an item mentioned in Article 3 and Article 5 of this law is brought in after being found, the relevant government authority must announce it without delay. If the owner of the item does not submit a claim for it within 1 year from the date of the first announcement, the item shall become the property of the Government. Furthermore, even if the owner, after submitting a claim, does not take custody of the item, it shall become the property of the Government. These matters shall be decided by the Judiciary.

(b) Among the items specified in subsection (a) of this Article, the relevant government authority has the discretion to auction and convert to money any items that are perishable by nature, living creatures, and items for which the maintenance cost is not commensurate with their value.

(c) When an announcement is made to find the owner of an item brought in under Article 3 and Article 5 of this law, if an owner claims the item within the specified period, the item shall be handed over to its owner only after the payment of expenses incurred in finding the owner and the expenses incurred for its maintenance.

Action Under Another Law

    If another law specifies that an item found in the sea or on the land of the Maldives must be presented to a specific government authority, the item shall be presented to the authority mandated by that law. The matter concerning that item shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of that law.

Making of Regulations

    The regulations required to be made under this law shall be made and implemented by a party or parties designated by the President of the Republic.
