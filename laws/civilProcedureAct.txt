(b) Both in and out of court, the conduct of judges must be such as to maintain the confidence of the public, lawyers, and other persons working in the judiciary, in the independence of the judiciary. In that regard, while a case is before the court, they must not consult with any party involved in that case regarding it. Nor shall they engage in any transaction that might affect a decision made by the court in that case or that might obstruct the fairness of the trial stages.

**36. Not to Abuse the Power of the Position**

(d) While the trial stages of a case are proceeding, a party involved in that case shall not be allowed to commit any act, whether by words, writing, or action, that would be detrimental to the interest of another party involved in that case.

**41. Parties to Act in Good Faith**

In all stages of the trial of a civil claim, the parties to that case must act in good faith and to uphold the objectives stated in Articles 4 and 5 of this Act.

(c) If there is more than one defendant in a particular case, and the claims filed against them are so interconnected that it would be a quicker resolution to conduct the trials related to those claims together and decide on them, instead of filing separate claims, such a claim may be filed in the relevant court of the judicial district to which the place where one of those parties ordinarily resides belongs.

(d) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Article, in the following circumstances, a claim may be filed against a person in the following courts, instead of filing the claim in the relevant court of the judicial district to which the place where the defendant ordinarily resides at the time of filing the claim belongs:
(1) In a case relating to a contract, the relevant court of the judicial district to which the place where the most essential obligations of that contract must be performed belongs;

(g) If at the time of filing a claim the place where the defendant ordinarily resides is not known, and the other conditions for determining jurisdiction under this Article are not met, the claimant has the discretion to file the claim in the relevant court of the judicial district to which the place where the defendant ordinarily resides belongs at the time of filing that claim.

The relevant clauses of an agreement that specify the party conferring jurisdiction in relation to a dispute arising from an agreement shall be considered a separate agreement, distinct from the other clauses of that agreement. However, if the sole reason for challenging the validity of such an agreement specifying the party conferring jurisdiction in relation to a dispute arising from an agreement is the challenge to the validity of the legal agreement made between the two parties, such a claim shall not be filed.

(b) Even in circumstances where the matters stated in subsection (a) of this Article do not apply to a particular case, if all parties involved in that case are Maldivian citizens, and if doing so is desirable for the purpose of establishing justice, the courts of the Maldives shall have jurisdiction to hear that case.

(c) In determining whether hearing a case as described in subsection (b) of this Article in a court of the Maldives is desirable for the purpose of establishing justice, the court to which that case has been submitted must consider all matters relating to that case.

(2) Whether or not a circumstance exists that prohibits the case from being conducted in a court of the Maldives;
(3) Whether or not it is most appropriate to submit that case to a court of another country;
(4) Whether or not the remedy requested by the claimant can be adequately granted by a court of another country;
(5) The costs and convenience involved in proceeding with the case in the Maldives or in a court of another country;

**215. Giving Directions on How the Case Will Proceed**

The court must give directions to the parties on how the cases will proceed on the Fast Track at two stages. They are, the directions given upon sending the case to be heard on the Fast Track, and the directions given at the stage of exchanging the pre-trial checklist. And the court must, as far as possible, try to give directions to the parties only at these two stages, and to give those directions without holding hearings.

**216. Giving Directions upon Determining the Track**

(a) Upon determining that a particular case will be heard on the Fast Track, when the court gives notice to the parties informing them of that fact, directions on how the case will proceed on that track must be given to the parties of the case. The purpose of giving directions on how the case will proceed at this stage is to identify in advance the issues on which the parties disagree, and to disclose the evidence needed for the case and prepare it for submission to the trial.

(b) When the court gives directions under subsection (a) of this Article, a timetable indicating the stages to be completed to prepare for the trial of that case from the date the directions are given until the trial of the case is held, and the time set for completing those stages, must be determined and notified to the parties. And a date for holding the trial of the case or a maximum period for which the trial of the case will last must be determined and notified to the parties.

(c) The period determined by the court for conducting the trial of the case under subsection (b) of this Article must be a period determined in a way that it does not exceed 3 (three) weeks from the date the notice is sent informing of the determination of the track of the case.

(d) Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this Article, in a situation where the court finds that it is not important to proceed with a particular stage among the stages specified in subsection (a) of this Article as stages to be completed before the trial is held, the court may determine that such a stage does not need to be completed, and the trial may be expedited.

(e) In formulating the timetable under this Article, the court must, as far as possible, consult with the parties. And precedence must be given to determining periods that are agreeable to the parties.

(f) If the parties wish, this Article does not prevent them from formulating a timetable agreeable to the parties and submitting it to the court. And if the submissions so made by the parties are submissions acceptable to the court, those submissions may be accepted, and it may be determined to act in accordance with those submissions.

Or, instead of conducting the entire procedure, it may determine specific documents or specific types of documents that the parties must disclose and inform the parties.

**219. Amending the Timetable for Proceeding with the Case**

(a) If a party wishes to make a change to a date or period determined by the court for any of the following matters when giving directions under Article 216 of this Act or when determining a timetable under Article 217 of this Act, that may be submitted to the court:

(c) If any party has not completed and submitted the pre-trial checklist by the date specified under subsection (b) of this Article, the court may give the parties an additional period of 7 (seven) days and order them to submit that information.

(d) If one party has submitted a pre-trial checklist and another party has not, or if all the information specified in the checklist has not been submitted, or if the court finds it important to hold a hearing to give directions necessary for preparing for the trial of the case, the court may give directions as it sees fit in relation to the matter.
