Law on the Transfer of Ownership

1.
If the ownership of a property is to be transferred to another party through a gift, bequest, or sale, by means other than through the government, the matter shall be submitted to the court in accordance with the following points:

(a)
The property must belong to the giving party or the selling party.

(b)
The giving party or the selling party must be present in the court session and request the transfer of ownership.

(c)
If the party is unable to attend in person as stated in (b) due to a valid excuse, they may appoint another person to attend the court session on their behalf in the presence of two just witnesses. When making such an appointment, a document containing a complete statement of the desired manner of ownership transfer, prepared in accordance with Sharia principles, must be written and signed by all four persons (with their names and addresses clearly stated).

(d)
The party receiving the ownership must also act in accordance with the rules stipulated in subsections (b) and (c) of this article.

(e)
Except for the circumstances mentioned in subsection (f), when the appointed representative appears in the court session, they must submit the document signed by the four persons mentioned in subsection (c). The two witnesses mentioned in the document must also be present in the session to testify that it is a true statement.

(f)
If the giving party, the selling party, or the receiving party is abroad, making it difficult to submit a document signed by the four persons as mentioned in subsections (c) and (d), they may appoint another person (with full name and address) to attend the court session on their behalf. A written and signed document, indicating the appointment and the desired manner of transferring or receiving ownership, prepared in accordance with Sharia principles, must be submitted with the signature of an official authority (such as a Notary Public or a Maldivian Embassy).

(g)
When transferring the ownership of a registered item or place, excluding private land and the buildings thereon, an official letter of no objection from the registering authority must be obtained.

2.
If, after a transfer of property by a gift, bequest, or sale, one of the two parties needs to submit the matter to the court for validation, a written agreement signed by both parties, along with the signatures of the witnesses present at the time of signing, must be submitted to the court.

3.
Upon the conclusion of a court case for the transfer of ownership as per Articles 1 and 2, a report on the court's decision shall be provided to both concerned parties immediately following the conclusion.

4.
Any case concerning a property or a place for which ownership has been transferred in accordance with this law can only be filed in court with the judicial report on how the matter was concluded.
