Principles to be Considered in Determining Electoral Constituencies

10.
(a) In determining the electoral constituencies for each administrative division in accordance with the principle stated in Article 9 of this Act, the Elections Commission shall consider the following principles:
1. Determining electoral constituencies in a manner that equalizes the population of electoral constituencies within an administrative division as much as possible.
2. After considering the changes in population figures, determining electoral constituencies without changing the previously determined electoral constituencies as much as possible.
3. After considering the population figures, determining in a way that the population of one island belongs to one electoral constituency as much as possible.
4. Determining in a way that the population of nearby islands within that administrative division belongs to one electoral constituency.
5. Determining electoral constituencies in a way that does not disrupt the social harmony and unity of that administrative division's community. In this regard, if the population of one island needs to be divided and joined with an electoral constituency of another island, such an island shall be divided only if its total population exceeds 5,000 (five thousand) people.
6. If more than one electoral constituency is determined within a single island, contiguous areas shall be determined as one electoral constituency, and electoral constituencies shall be determined with due regard to the administrative or social divisions of that island.
