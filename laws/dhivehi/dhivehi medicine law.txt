"Any of the following acts, namely the practice of Dhivehi medicine, the performance of sorcery, the performance of circumcision, and the practice of midwifery, must only be carried out after the party wishing to do so has applied in writing to the Ministry of Health and has received a permit. Accordingly, the Ministry of Health is empowered to grant a permit to a party deemed fit to receive such a permit, and to revoke such permits."

This law establishes the Ministry of Health as the sole regulatory body for issuing and retracting licenses for these traditional and medical services in the Maldives.
